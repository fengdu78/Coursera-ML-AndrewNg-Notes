矩阵 矩阵的乘法以及

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,262
how to multiply two matrices together.
如何将两个矩阵相乘

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,935
When we talk about the method
我们会使用这样一种方法

5
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:09,412
in linear regression for how
在线性回归中用以解决

6
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:11,251
to solve for the parameters,
参数计算的问题

7
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:13,195
theta zero and theta one, all in one shot.
这种方法会把θ0、θ1等参数都放在一起来计算

8
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:16,601
So, without needing an iterative algorithm like gradient descent.
也就是说 我们不需要一个迭代的梯度下降算法

9
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,005
When we talk about that algorithm,
当我们谈到这个算法的时候

10
00:00:18,005 --> 00:00:19,982
it turns out that matrix, matrix
就会发现矩阵以及矩阵间的乘法运算

11
00:00:19,982 --> 00:00:23,086
multiplication is one of the key steps that you need to know.
是你必须理解的关键步骤之一

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,885
So, let's, as usual, start with an example.
所以让我们像往常那样 从一个例子开始

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,558
Let's say I have two matrices
比方说 我有两个矩阵

14
00:00:30,558 --> 00:00:33,060
and I want to multiply them together.
我想将它们相乘

15
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,343
Let me again just reference this
让我先只是按照这个例子做一遍（乘法）

16
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:37,441
example and then I'll tell you in a little bit what happens.
然后告诉你这其中运算的细节

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,154
So, the first thing
那么  我要做的第一件事是

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,589
I'm gonna do is, I'm going
我先把

19
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:43,154
to pull out the first
右边这个矩阵的第一列

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,545
column of this matrix on the right.
提取出来

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,135
And I'm going to take this
然后我将会把

22
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,163
matrix on the left and
左边的这个矩阵和

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,385
multiply it by, you know, a vector.
之前取出来的这一列（前面提过的，向量）相乘

24
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,188
That's just this first column, OK?
这只是第一列  是吧？

25
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,385
And it turns out if I
然后我们可以看到 如果我

26
00:00:56,385 --> 00:00:59,067
do that I am going to get the vector 11, 9.
这么做 我就会得到向量（11,9）

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,068
So, this is the same matrix
所以这是与上个视频的矩阵

28
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:05,932
vector multiplication as you saw in the last videos.
和向量的乘法是一样的

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,934
I worked this out in advance so, I know it's 11, 9.
我已经提前算出了这个结果 是（11,9）

30
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:10,519
And, then, the second thing
那么 之后的第二件事

31
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:12,811
I'm going to do is, I'm going
我要做的就是

32
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,752
to pull out the second column,
我将把第二列再单独提出出来

33
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,537
this matrix on the right and
右边这个矩阵的第二列

34
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:18,575
I am then going to
然后我将要把它和

35
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:20,174
take this matrix on the left,
左边这个矩阵相乘

36
00:01:20,174 --> 00:01:21,398
right, so, it will be that matrix,
是的吧  所以 这就是那个矩阵

37
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,476
and multiply it by
用右边的第二列

38
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,902
that second column on the right.
来乘以这个矩阵

39
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:26,360
So, again, this is a matrix
因此 同样的 这是一个矩阵和

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,960
vector multiplication set, which
向量的乘法运算  这

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,643

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,250
vector, you get 10,
你会得到

45
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,214
14 and by
（10,14）这个结果

46
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:37,472
the way, if you want to practice
顺便说一下 如果你想练习

50
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:45,743
to take these two results and
将得到的这两个结果放在一起

51
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:48,398
put them together, and that will be my answer.
那么这就是我的答案了

52
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,962

56
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:56,294
in this matrix is just by
就是

57
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:57,914
taking my elements 11,
把我的（11,9）

58
00:01:57,914 --> 00:02:00,137

how to multiply a matrix by
将两个矩阵相乘的

64
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:12,248
another matrix.
详细方法与过程

65
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,094
You basically look at the
每次你只需要看

66
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:17,045
second matrix one column at a time, and you assemble the answers.
第二个矩阵的一列    然后把你的答案拼凑起来

67
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,199
And again, we will step
再次强调下 我们将一步步的来计算

68
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,455
through this much more carefully in
几秒中的时间里需要非常仔细

69
00:02:19,455 --> 00:02:20,754
a second, but I just
但我也要指出

70
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,852
want to point out also, this
我也要指出的是

71
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:26,301
first example is a 2x3 matrix matrix.
第一个例子是一个2X3矩阵

72
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:28,548
Multiplying that by a
乘以一个

73
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,649
3x2 matrix, and the

turns out to be a 2x2
是一个2x2的

76
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,802
matrix.
矩阵

77
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:39,121
And again, we'll see in a second why this was the case.
我们将很快知道为什么是这个结果

78
00:02:39,122 --> 00:02:40,484
All right.
好的

79
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,637
That was the mechanics of the calculation.
这是计算的技巧

80
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:43,745
Let's actually look at the
让我们再看看

81
00:02:43,745 --> 00:02:44,953
details and look at what
这其中的细节

82
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,305
exactly happened.
看看究竟发生了什么

83
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:48,082
Here are details.
下面就是详细的过程

84
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:49,471
I have a matrix A and
我有一个矩阵A

85
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:51,325
I want to multiply that
我要把它乘以

86
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,088
with a matrix B, and the result
矩阵B  其结果

87
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:56,143
will be some new matrix C. And
会是一个新的矩阵C

88
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,168
it turns out you can only
并且你会发现你只能

89
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:59,238
multiply together matrices whose
相乘那些维度

90
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:00,714
dimensions match so A
匹配的矩阵

91
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,239
is an m by n matrix,
因此如果A是一个m×n的矩阵

92
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,468
so m columns, n columns and
就是说m行n列

93
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:05,394
I am going to multiply
我将要用它与

94
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:06,480
that with an n by o
一个n×o的矩阵相乘

95
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,232
and it turns out this n
并且实际上这里的n

96
00:03:08,232 --> 00:03:10,306
here must match this n
必须匹配这里的这个n

97
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,978
here, so the number of columns
所以第一个矩阵的列的数目

98
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:16,778
in first matrix must equal to the number of rows in second matrix.
必须等于第二矩阵中的行的数目

99
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,035
And the result of this
并且相乘得到的结果

100
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:20,639
product will be an M
结果会是一个m×o的矩阵

101
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,204
by O matrix, like the the matrix C here.
就像这个矩阵C这样

102
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,822
And, in the previous
并且 在前面的视频中

103
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,743
video, everything we did corresponded
我们所做的一切都符合这个规则

104
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,380
to this special case of OB
这是一种当矩阵B的o值

105
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,588
equal to 1.
等于1的特殊情况（指的是矩阵和向量相乘）

106
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,150
Okay?
明白了吗？

107
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,469
That was, that was in case of B being a vector.
这是在B是一个向量的情况下

108
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,522
But now, we are going to
但是现在 我们要处理

109
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,805
view of the case of values of O larger than 1.
O的值大于1的情况

110
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,533
So, here's how you
所以 这里就是你怎样

111
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,564
multiply together the two matrices.
把两个矩阵相乘

112
00:03:44,564 --> 00:03:46,349

first column of B
B矩阵的第一列

116
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,782
and treat that as a vector,
把取出的这列看成一个向量

117
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:56,098
and multiply the matrix A,
并乘以矩阵A

118
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,909
with the first column of B,
用B矩阵的第一列

119
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,632
and the result of that will
这个计算结果将是

120
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:00,370
be a M by 1 vector,
m×1的矩阵（也就是一个向量）

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,726
and we're going to put that over here.
我们把结果先放在这里

122
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,481
Then, I'm going to
然后 我将要取

123
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,048
take the second column

this is another n by
那么我会又得到一个n×1的向量

126
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,501
one vector, so, this column
也就是 这里的这一列

127
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:16,690
here, this is right, n

00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:29,273
And, so on.
依此类推

135
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:30,035

Just to say that again.
再说一遍

146
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,510
The ith column of the
矩阵C的第i列

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,235
Let 's say, I want to multiply together these two matrices.
比方说我想把这两个矩阵相乘

159
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,208
So, what I'm going to
那么我首先要做的是

160
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:20,178
do is, first pull
先取出

161
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,535
out the first column
我的第二个矩阵的

162
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,370
of my second matrix, that
第一列

163
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,185
was matrix B, that was
就是这个矩阵B 这就是

164
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:29,133
my matrix B on the previous slide.
上一张幻灯片上出现的矩阵B

165
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,660
And, I therefore, have this
因此 我就这么

166
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,917
matrix times my vector and
用矩阵和我取的向量相乘

167
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,350
so, oh, let's do this calculation quickly.
所以    让我们快速的计算这个结果

168
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,518
There's going to be equal to,
这等于

169
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:39,048
right, 1, 3 times 0,
没错  （1,3）乘以（0,3）

170
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,238
3 so that gives 1
所以 就是

171
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,930
times 0, plus 3 times 3.
1x0+3x3（9）

172
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,322
And, the second element
此外 第二元素

173
00:05:48,322 --> 00:05:49,530
is going to be 2,
就是（2，5）

174
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,678
5 times 0, 3 so, that's going to
乘以（0，3）

175
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:52,739
be two times 0 plus 5
就是0x2+5x3（15）

176
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,276
times 3 and that is
那么结果出来了

177
00:05:57,276 --> 00:06:02,242
9,15, actually didn't
（9,15）实际上该用绿色的颜色标记

178
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:03,672
write that in green, so this
所以这就是（9.15）

179
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:09,365
is nine fifteen, and then mix.
那么

180
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:12,061
I am going to pull out
我将同样的取出

181
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,451
the second column of this,
这个的第二列

182
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,174
and do the corresponding
做相同的计算

183
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,170
calculation so there's this
所以

184
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,477
matrix times this vector 1, 2.
这是这个矩阵乘以（1,2）

185
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:22,288
Let's also do this
让我们快点算吧

186
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,814
quickly, so that's one times
所以这是

187
00:06:23,814 --> 00:06:27,362
one plus three times two.
1x1 + 3x2

188
00:06:27,362 --> 00:06:28,973
So that deals with that
那么这就处理了这一行

189
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,868
row, let's do the
让我们计算另一行

190
00:06:30,868 --> 00:06:34,223
other one, so let's see,
让我们来看看

191
00:06:34,223 --> 00:06:37,510
that gives me two times
这次是

192
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:41,926
one plus times two,
2x1 + 5x2

193
00:06:41,926 --> 00:06:43,493
so that is going to
因此这就等于

194
00:06:43,493 --> 00:06:46,176
be equal to, let's see,
我们看一下

195
00:06:46,176 --> 00:06:47,464
one times one plus three times
1x1 + 3x1结果是4

196
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:50,378
one is four and two
2x1 + 5x2

197
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:52,282
times one plus five times two
结果是

198
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:53,923
is twelve.

199
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,660
So now I have these two
所以现在我有两个这个了

200
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,448
you, and so my
因此我得到的

201
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,343
outcome, so the product
这两个矩阵

202
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,714
of these two matrices is going
相乘的结果就是

203
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,831
to be, this goes
这个在这儿

204
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:07,232
here and this
那个放那边

205
00:07:07,232 --> 00:07:09,828
goes here, so I
所以我得到了

206
00:07:09,828 --> 00:07:14,632
get nine fifteen and
9,15和

207
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,831
four twelve and you

208
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,657
may notice also that the result

to be that first two times
第一个矩阵的2乘以第二的矩阵的2

213
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,415

214
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,460
is itself also a two by two matrix.
也是一个2x2的矩阵

215
