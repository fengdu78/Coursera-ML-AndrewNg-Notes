1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,920
Matrix multiplication is really
矩阵乘法运算非常实用
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,302
useful since you can pack
因为你可以通过矩阵乘法

3
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:05,494
a lot of computation into just
将大量运算打包到

4
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:08,092
one matrix multiplication operation.
一次矩阵的乘法运算中

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,829
But you should be careful of how you use them.
但是怎样使用这个方法你要提起注意

6
00:00:10,829 --> 00:00:12,103
In this video I want to
在这个视频中 我想

7
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:16,974
tell you about a few properties of matrix multiplication.
介绍一些矩阵乘法的特性

8
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,678
When working with just raw
运算时 如果仅仅使用实数

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,653
numbers or when working with
或者说是标量

10
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:25,797
scalars, multiplication is commutative.
乘法是可以交换的

11
00:00:25,797 --> 00:00:27,459
And what I mean by that is
我的意思是说

12
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:29,272
if you take three times
如果你用3乘以5

13
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:30,873
five, that is equal
那么这个运算等同于

14
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:32,368
to five times three and
5乘以3

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,371
the ordering of this multiplication doesn't matter.
这个乘法运算中两个量的顺序不重要

16
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:38,271
And this is called the commutative
这就是实数乘法

17
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:41,952
property of multiplication of real numbers.
的交换律

18
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:43,765
It turns out this property that
通过这个定律

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,299
you can, you know, reverse
你能够颠倒

20
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,317
the order in which you
乘法运算中变量的顺序

21
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:50,217
multiply things, this is not true for matrix multiplication.So
但是这不能应用在矩阵乘法中

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,294
concretely, if A and
所以 具体来讲 如果变量A和

23
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,423
B are matrices, then in
B是矩阵 通常情况下

24
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:55,120
general, A times B is
A乘以B

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,653
not equal to B times
不等于B乘以A

26
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:58,220
A.  So just be careful of that.
因此应该注意到这一点

27
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,530
It's not okay to arbitrarily reverse
随意颠倒矩阵

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,545
the order in which you are multiplying matrices.
乘法的顺序是不可行的

29
00:01:02,545 --> 00:01:04,892
So, we say that matrix multiplication
因此 我们说 矩阵乘法

30
00:01:04,892 --> 00:01:06,420
is not commutative, it's a fancy
是不可交换的，这是一个奇特

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,480
way of saying it.
的说法

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,028
As a concrete example, here
举一个具体的例子

33
00:01:11,028 --> 00:01:13,156
are two matrices, matrix 1100
有两个矩阵 矩阵[1100]

34
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,302
times 0020, and if you multiply
乘以[0020] 如果你将

35
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:17,018
these two matrices, you get this result on the right.
这两个矩阵相乘 你会得到右边的结果

36
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,428
Now, let's swap around the order of these two matrices.
现在 让我们左右交换这两个矩阵的顺序

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,857
So, I'm going to take these
我们对这两个

38
00:01:21,857 --> 00:01:24,244
two matrices and just reverse them.
矩阵 仅仅交换了一下位置

39
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,511
It turns out if you multiply
结果呢 你对这两个

40
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,629
these two matrices, you get
矩阵相乘的时候 你在右边得出了

41
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,525
the second answer on the
第二种答案

42
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:31,423
right and, you know, real
你看 很明显

43
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:33,652
clearly, these two matrices are
这个矩阵不同于

44
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:36,099
not equal to each other.
之前的结果

45
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,159
So, in fact, in
所以 事实上

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,120
general, if you have
在通常情况下 如果你

47
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,585
a matrix operation like
做一个矩阵运算

48
00:01:41,585 --> 00:01:44,793
A times B. If A
比如A乘以B 如果

49
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:47,301
is an m by n matrix
A是一个m×n的矩阵

50
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:49,188
and B is an by
B是一个n×m的矩阵

51
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,415
M matrix, just as an example.
以此举例

52
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,974
Then, it turns out
这样 结果表明

53
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,735
that the matrix A times
矩阵A乘以B

54
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:59,042
B right, is going
会得到

55
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,258
to be an m by
一个m×m

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,792
m matrix, where as
的矩阵 当情况是

57
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:06,410
the matrix b x a
矩阵 BXA

58
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,390
is going to be an n
的时候会得到一个n×n的矩阵

59
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,928
by n matrix so the
所以

60
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,406
dimensions don't even match, right,
结果中即使是矩阵的维度都不相同 好吧

61
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,283
so A times B and
所以矩阵A乘以B和

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,647
B times A may not even be the same dimension.
B乘以A可能得到不相同的维度

63
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:17,762
In the example on the left,
在左边的例子中

64
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,265
I have all two by two matrices,
我有使用的都是2×2的矩阵

65
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,342
so the dimensions were the same,
这样的维度是相同的

66
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,688
but in general reversing the
但是通常情况

67
00:02:22,688 --> 00:02:25,285
order of the matrices
交换矩阵顺序

68
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,301
can even change the dimension
会改变结果维度

69
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:30,030
of the outcome so
因此

70
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,291
matrix multiplication is not commutative.
矩阵乘法是不服从交换律的

71
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,302
Here's the next I want to talk about.
这是我接下来要讲的

72
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:37,663
So, when talking about real
所以当谈到实数

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,731
numbers, or scalars, let's
或标量的时候 请看

74
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:42,859
see, I have 3 times 5 times 2.
我用3×5×2.

75
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,848
I can either multiply 5
我也可以先用5

76
00:02:45,848 --> 00:02:47,625
times 2 first, and
乘以2

77
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,394
I can compute this as 3 times 10.
然后用3乘以10

78
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,936
Or, I can multiply
再或者 我可以将

79
00:02:52,936 --> 00:02:54,635
three times five for us and
3乘以5

80
00:02:54,635 --> 00:02:55,804
I can compute this as, you
我可以这样计算

81
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:58,029
know fifteen times two and
再用15乘以2

82
00:02:58,029 --> 00:02:59,885
both of these give you the same answer, right?
这两种算法得到了相同的答案 对吧？

83
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:01,007
Each, both of these is equal
这两个方法 都等于30

84
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,895
to thirty so Whether I
所以 无论

85
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,433
multiply five times
先用5乘以2

86
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,185
two first or whether I
或者

87
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:09,746
multiply three times five
先用3乘以5

88
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:12,663
first because well, three
都是因为

89
00:03:12,663 --> 00:03:14,670
times five times two
3乘以5再乘以2

90
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,389
is equal to three times
都等于3乘以

91
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:18,894
five times two.
5再乘以2

92
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,445
And this is called the
这就是 所谓的

93
00:03:20,445 --> 00:03:27,022
associative property of role number multiplication.
数乘的结合律

94
00:03:27,022 --> 00:03:30,695
It turns out that matrix multiplication is associative.
事实证明 矩阵乘法也符合结合律

95
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:32,335
So concretely, let's say
因此 具体来说

96
00:03:32,335 --> 00:03:33,452
I have a product of three
做三个矩阵的乘积

97
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:34,762
matrices, A times B times
矩阵A乘以矩阵B再乘以

98
00:03:34,762 --> 00:03:36,189
C. Then I can
矩阵C.然后我就可以

99
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:37,818
compute this either as A
A乘以

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,412
times, B times C
B×C

101
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,838
or I can compute this as
或者可以计算

102
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:45,310
A times B, times C
A×B 再乘以C

103
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,125
and these will actually give me the same answer.
这将给出相同的答案

104
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,310
I'm not going to prove this, but
我不做这个运算的证明 但是

105
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,556
you can just take my word for it, I guess.
我想你可以把我的话记下来

106
00:03:51,556 --> 00:03:52,692
So just be clear what I mean by
所以只要通过这两种情况明白我的意思

107
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:54,340
these two cases, let's look
就行了 让我们来看看

108
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,263
at first one first case.
第一种情况

109
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,345
What I mean by that is
我是说

110
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:58,405
if you actually want to compute
如果你要计算

111
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,925
A times B times C, what
A×B×C

112
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,410
you can do is you can
你可以通过

113
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,078
first compute B times C.
先计算B矩阵和C矩阵的积

114
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,423
So that D equals B time
这样D等于B×C

115
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:05,848
C, then compute A times
这时候计算A×D

116
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:07,178
D.  And so this is really
事实上这就是

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,605
computing a times B
A×B×C

118
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:12,406
times C.  Or, for
或者是

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,895
this second case, You can
第二种情况下

120
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,065
compute this as, you can
你可以这样计算

121
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:17,673
set E equals A
设定E等于A×B

122
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,142
times B.  Then compute E
然后计算

123
00:04:19,142 --> 00:04:20,750
times C.  And this
ExC

124
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,912
is then the same as a
这就等同于

125
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,526
times B times C
A×B×C

126
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,322
and it turns out that both
结果表明

127
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:30,115
of these options will give
这两种选择

128
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:33,702
you, is guaranteed to give you the same answer.
都能保证给出相同的答案

129
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,115
And so we say that matrix
所以说矩阵乘法

130
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:39,692
multiplication does enjoy the associative property.
能够服从结合律

131
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:40,592
Okay?
好吧？

132
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:42,752
And don't worry about the terminology
同时不用担心术语

133
00:04:42,752 --> 00:04:44,609
associative and commutative that's
结合律和交换律

134
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,083
why there's not really going to use
因为在这个课程后面的讲解中

135
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,586
this terminology later in these
不会使用这些术语

136
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:50,608
class, so don't worry about memorizing those terms.
不必担心这些条条框框

137
00:04:50,608 --> 00:04:52,841
Finally, I want to
最后 我想告诉大家的

138
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,552
tell you about the identity
是单位矩阵

139
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:56,676
matrix, which is special matrix.
一种特殊的矩阵

140
00:04:56,676 --> 00:04:58,202
So let's again make the
因此 我们再次类比

141
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,296
analogy to what we know
之前用到的实数的情况

142
00:04:59,296 --> 00:05:01,342
of raw numbers, so when dealing
当处理

143
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,842
with raw numbers or scalar
纯数字或标量的时候

144
00:05:02,842 --> 00:05:04,562
numbers, the number one,
数值1时

145
00:05:04,562 --> 00:05:06,131
is you can think
你可以认为

146
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,756
of it as the identity of multiplication,
它是一个乘法单位

147
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,853
and what I mean by that
我用1的意思是

148
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,885
is for any number
对于任何实数Z

149
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,942
Z, the number 1
数字1

150
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,803
times z is equal
乘以Z

151
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,754
to z times one, and
等于Z乘以1

152
00:05:19,754 --> 00:05:21,550
that's just equal to
它们的结果

153
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,548
the number z, right, for any raw number.
对于任意实数都是右面的Z

154
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,128
Z. So 1 is
因此1是

155
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:29,891
the identity operation and so it satisfies this equation.
一个单位操作 而且它满足这个等式

156
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,755
So it turns out that
事实就是

157
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:33,297
in the space of matrices as
在矩阵空间

158
00:05:33,297 --> 00:05:35,453
an identity matrix as well.
它就是一个单位矩阵

159
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:38,375
And it's unusually denoted i,
通常它记作I

160
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,573
or sometimes we write it
有时我们把它记作

161
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:40,945
as i of n by
n×n的矩阵i

162
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,079
n we want to make explicit the dimensions.
以明确标出矩阵的维度

163
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,355
So I subscript n by n
所以下标写作n×n的时候

164
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:47,391
is the n by n identity matrix.
是指n行n列的单位矩阵

165
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,339
And so there's a different identity
这是不同单位矩阵

166
00:05:49,339 --> 00:05:53,375
matrix for each dimension n and are a few examples.
在不同维度n中是不一样的 这里有一些例子

167
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,912
Here's the two by two identity
这是一个2×2的单位矩阵

168
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:56,447
matrix, here's the three
这个是3×3的

169
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:59,882
by three identity matrix, here's the four by four identity matrix.
这是4×4的

170
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,858
So the identity matrix, has the
所以单位矩阵

171
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,602
property that it has
的特性就是

172
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:06,348
ones along the diagonals,
沿对角线都是1

173
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,325
right, and so on and
等等

174
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,915
is zero everywhere else, and
其他位置都是0

175
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:14,012
so, by the way the
所以顺便提一下

176
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:17,425
one by one identity matrix is just a number one.
1×1单位矩阵就是个数字1

177
00:06:17,425 --> 00:06:18,740
This is one by one matrix
这是一个1×1矩阵

178
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,090
just and it's not a very
它不是非常有意思的单位矩阵

179
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,242
interesting identity matrix and informally
它比较非正式

180
00:06:23,285 --> 00:06:24,593
when I or others are being
我和多数人对这个矩阵都感到比较模糊

181
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,438
sloppy, very often, we will
更多情况下

182
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:28,878
write the identity matrix using fine notation.
我们使用更明确的符号表示

183
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,574
I draw, you know, let's
我划出来

184
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:31,675
go back to it and just write 1111,
回到这里 写1111

185
00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:33,565
dot, dot, dot, 1
点 点 点 1

186
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:34,928
and then we'll, maybe, somewhat
这样也许一定程度上

187
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,650
sloppily write a bunch of zeros there.
拖泥带水写了一堆零在这里

188
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,750
And these zeros, this
这些零

189
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,474
big zero, this big zero
大零 大零

190
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:44,262
that's meant to denote that this
这意思是表示

191
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:46,174
matrix is zero everywhere except for
这个矩阵到处是零

192
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:47,367
the diagonals, so this is just
除了对角线上

193
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,680
how I might sloppily write
这就是比较拖沓的写法

194
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,251
this identity matrix
写这个单位矩阵

195
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:55,138
She says property that for
这说明一个特性

196
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:57,493
any matrix A, A times
对于任何矩阵A A乘以

197
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:59,635
identity i times A
单位矩阵I

198
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,892
A. So that's a lot
乘以A

199
00:07:00,892 --> 00:07:04,782
like this equation that we have up here.
这就跟举得这个等式非常相像

200
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:06,502
One times z equals z times
1×Z等于Z×1

201
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:08,427
one, equals z itself so
结果是Z本身

202
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,972
I times A equals A
I×A等于

203
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:12,566
times I equals A.  Just
A×I

204
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,095
make sure we have the dimensions right, so
只要确保它们有相同的维度

205
00:07:14,095 --> 00:07:15,721
if A is a n
所以如果A是一个n×n

206
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,065
by n matrix, then this
的矩阵

207
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,952
identity matrix that's an
单位矩阵就应该是

208
00:07:19,952 --> 00:07:22,797
m by n identity matrix.
n×n维度

209
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,573
And if A is m by
如果A是m×n矩阵

210
00:07:24,573 --> 00:07:26,595
n then this identity
那么单位矩阵

211
00:07:26,595 --> 00:07:28,766
matrix, right, for matrix
使矩阵乘法

212
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,270
multiplication make sense that has a
有意义  就需要一个

213
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:33,008
m by n matrix because
m×n矩阵

214
00:07:33,008 --> 00:07:34,305
this m has a match
因为使这个m匹配

215
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,948
up that m And
上一个m

216
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:38,619
in either case the outcome
在任何情况下

217
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:40,042
of this process is you
这个过程的结果是

218
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,025
get back to Matrix A, which
你的到的结果A

219
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,501
is m by n.
维度是m×n

220
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,068
So whenever we write
任何时候我们写

221
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,728
the identity matrix I, you
单位矩阵I

222
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,798
know, very often the dimension rightwill
它所暗含的维度

223
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,473
be implicit from the context.
是从上下文中得到的

224
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:53,665
So these two I's they' re
对于这两个矩阵

225
00:07:53,665 --> 00:07:55,645
actually different dimension matrices, one
它们有不一样的维度

226
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:56,789
may be N by N, the other
一个是n×n

227
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:58,985
is M by M But when
另一个是m×m

228
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:00,505
we want to make the dimension
我们想要

229
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,831
of the matrix explicit, then sometimes
明确矩阵维度 有时候

230
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,468
we'll write to this I subscript
我们需要在下标中写出

231
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,470
N by N, kind of like we have up here.
n×n 跟前面的一样

232
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,854
But very often the dimension will be implicit.
但很多时候维度是隐含的

233
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,513
Finally, just want to point
最后要指出的是

234
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:14,606
out that earlier I
之前我提到

235
00:08:14,606 --> 00:08:16,458
said that A times B
A乘以B

236
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:19,069
is not in general equal
通常并不等于

237
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,595
to B times A, right?
B乘以A 对不对？

238
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:25,687
That for most matrices A and B, this is not true.
对于大多数矩阵A和B 这是不成立的

239
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,558
But when B is the identity matrix, this does hold true.
但是B是单位矩阵的时候这不成立

240
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,840
That A times the identity
A乘以单位矩阵

241
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,390
matrix does indeed equal to
等于

242
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,523
identity times A, it's
单位矩阵乘以A

243
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:35,858
just that this is not true
这对于其他矩阵

244
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:39,124
for other matrices, B in general.
B 一般是不成立的

245
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,645
So that's it for the
这是

246
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,994
properties of matrix multiplication.
基于矩阵乘法的特性

247
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,416
And the special matrices, like the
特殊矩阵 诸如

248
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,618
identity matrix I want to
单位矩阵 等
