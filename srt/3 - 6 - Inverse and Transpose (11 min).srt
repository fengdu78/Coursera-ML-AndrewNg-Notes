00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,540
In this video, I want to
在这一讲中
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,885
tell you about a couple of special
我将介绍一些特殊的矩阵运算

3
00:00:02,885 --> 00:00:04,848
matrix operations, called the
也就是矩阵的逆运算

4
00:00:04,848 --> 00:00:07,430
matrix inverse and the matrix transpose operation.
以及矩阵的转置运算

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,312
Let's start by talking about matrix
首先我们从逆矩阵开始

6
00:00:10,312 --> 00:00:12,928
inverse, and as
同往常一样

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,516
usual we'll start by thinking about
我们依然先思考一下

8
00:00:14,516 --> 00:00:17,248
how it relates to real numbers.
矩阵运算和实数运算的关系

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,803
In the last video, I said
在上一段视频中

10
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:20,625
that the number one plays the
我讲过 在实数空间中

11
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,570
role of the identity in
数字1扮演了单位矩阵的角色

12
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,059
the space of real numbers because
因为1和任何数相乘

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,851
one times anything is equal to itself.
其结果都是那个数本身

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,270
It turns out that real numbers
我们都知道

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,642
have this property that very
实数有这样的一个性质

16
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:33,093
number have an, that
那就是每一个实数

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,635
each number has an inverse,
都有一个倒数

18
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,637
for example, given the number
举个例子

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,552
three, there exists some
对于数字3

20
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:40,132
number, which happens to
一定存在某个数

21
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:41,544
be three inverse so that
是3的倒数

22
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:43,798
that number times gives you
这个倒数乘以3

23
00:00:43,798 --> 00:00:46,458
back the identity element one.
其乘积将得到单位元1

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,727
And so to me, inverse of course this is just one third.
当然 这里的逆也就是三分之一

25
00:00:50,727 --> 00:00:53,236
And given some other number,
而对于另一个数

26
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,360
maybe twelve there is
比如说12

27
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,312
some number which is the
那么一定有某个数

28
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,464
inverse of twelve written as
是12的倒数

29
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:01,600
twelve to the minus one, or
也可以写作12的-1次方

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,582
really this is just one twelve.
其实也就是1/12

31
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:07,092
So that when you multiply these two things together.
因此当你将这两个数相乘的时候

32
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:09,292
the product is equal to
其结果依然是等于1

33
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:12,367
the identity element one again.
或者可以称为单位元1

34
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,838
Now it turns out that in
然而事实上 在实数空间内

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,154
the space of real numbers, not everything has an inverse.
并非所有实数都有倒数

36
00:01:17,154 --> 00:01:19,148
For example the number zero
比如说数字0就没有倒数

37
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,981
does not have an inverse, right?
是吧？

38
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:25,410
Because zero's a zero inverse, one over zero that's undefined.
因为0的倒数 也就是1/0 是没有意义的

39
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,862
Like this one over zero is not well defined.
像这里 1除以0是未被定义的

40
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,419
And what we want to
在这一节剩下的内容中

41
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,453
do, in the rest of this
我们将要解决的一个问题

42
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:33,835
slide, is figure out what does
是求解一个矩阵的逆

43
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:38,341
it mean to compute the inverse of a matrix.
是什么意思

44
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:41,718
Here's the idea: If
概念如下

45
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,198
A is a n by
如果A是一个矩阵

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,078
n matrix, and it
其维度为m行m列

47
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:46,320
has an inverse, I will say
那么A矩阵有其逆矩阵

48
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,487
a bit more about that later, then
后面我还会详细介绍这一点

49
00:01:48,487 --> 00:01:49,927
the inverse is going to
那么这个逆矩阵

50
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:51,668
be written A to the
可以写成

51
00:01:51,668 --> 00:01:54,186
minus one and A
矩阵A的-1次方

52
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:55,798
times this inverse, A to
同时 矩阵A乘以它的逆矩阵

53
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:57,045
the minus one, is going to
A的-1次方

54
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,395
equal to A inverse times
也等于A的-1次方乘以A

55
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:00,741
A, is going to
其结果将等于

56
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:04,088
give us back the identity matrix.
单位矩阵

57
00:02:04,088 --> 00:02:04,958
Okay?
对吧？

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,037
Only matrices that are
只有维度是m行m列的矩阵

59
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,848
m by m for some the idea of M having inverse.
才有其逆矩阵

60
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,692
So, a matrix is
因此

61
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,010
M by M, this is also
如果一个矩阵的维度是m行m列

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,055
called a square matrix and
那么这个矩阵也可以称之为方阵

63
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:18,222
it's called square because
称其为方阵是因为

64
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:24,852
the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.
这类矩阵的行数和列数相等

65
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:26,516
Right and it turns out
好的

66
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,518
only square matrices have inverses,
实际上只有方阵才有逆矩阵

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,148
so A is a square
所以 如果A是一个方阵

68
00:02:31,148 --> 00:02:32,973
matrix, is m by m,
其维度是m行m列

69
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,198
on inverse this equation over here.
那么它将满足这个等式

70
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,568
Let's look at a concrete example,
接下来我们看一个具体的例子

71
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,530
so let's say I
假设说

72
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,090
have a matrix, three, four,
我们有这样一个矩阵 3 4

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,080
two, sixteen.
2 16

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,535
So this is a two by
这是一个2行2列的矩阵

75
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,788
two matrix, so it's
因此这个矩阵

76
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,159
a square matrix and so this
是一个方阵

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,442
may just could have an and
因此这个矩阵可以有它的逆矩阵

78
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,733
it turns out that I
假如说

79
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,308
happen to know the inverse
这个矩阵的逆矩阵是

80
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,810
of this matrix is zero point
0.4

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,675
four, minus zero point
-0.1

82
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,485
one, minus zero point
-0.05

83
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,687
zero five, zero zero seven five.
0.075

84
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,267
And if I take this matrix
那么如果我用这个逆矩阵

85
00:03:10,267 --> 00:03:12,273
and multiply these together it
和原来的矩阵相乘

86
00:03:12,273 --> 00:03:13,598
turns out what I get
那么

87
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,595
is the two by
我们将得到的结果

88
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,324
two identity matrix, I,
是一个2行2列的单位矩阵I

89
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,542
this is I two by two.
这就是矩阵I 维度是2行2列

90
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:21,365
Okay?
没问题吧？

91
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:22,308
And so on this slide,
在这张幻灯片上

92
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:24,416
you know this matrix is
这个矩阵就是矩阵A

93
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,199
the matrix A, and this matrix is the matrix A-inverse.
这个矩阵就是A的逆矩阵

94
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,622
And it turns out
结果是

95
00:03:28,622 --> 00:03:29,835
if that you are computing A
如果你要计算A乘以A的逆矩阵

96
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,385
times A-inverse, it turns out
或者说

97
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,742
if you compute A-inverse times
A的逆矩阵乘以A

98
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,821
A you also get back the identity matrix.
你将得到一个单位矩阵

99
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:38,640
So how did I
那么

100
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
find this inverse or how
怎样得到这个逆矩阵呢

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,698
did I come up with this inverse over here?
或者说我是怎么知道这个逆矩阵的呢？

102
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,048
It turns out that sometimes
实际上有时候你可以

103
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,731
you can compute inverses by hand
自己用笔算出来

104
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,745
but almost no one does that these days.
但可能现在没多少人这么求逆矩阵了

105
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,888
And it turns out there is
实际上我们有很多很好的软件

106
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,198
very good numerical software for
可以用来进行数学运算

107
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,447
taking a matrix and computing its inverse.
能很容易地对矩阵进行求逆运算

108
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,369
So again, this is one of
因此 同样地

109
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,310
those things where there are lots
对于这个问题

110
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,450
of open source libraries that
你可以在很多主流的编程环境中实现

111
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,748
you can link to from any
这些环境一般都有很多开源库

112
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:04,973
of the popular programming languages to compute inverses of matrices.
你可以直接运用来求解逆矩阵

113
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,892
Let me show you a quick example.
这里我举一个简单的例子

114
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,935
How I actually computed this inverse,
来说明一下怎样求逆矩阵

115
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,132
and what I did was I used software called Optive.
我将使用一个叫Octave的软件

116
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,437
So let me bring that up.
打开这个软件

117
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:17,186
We will see a lot about Optive later.
之后我们还会更多地用到Octave

118
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:18,903
Let me just quickly show you an example.
这里我只是很快地举一个例子

119
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,078
Set my matrix A to
定义一个矩阵A

120
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,274
be equal to that matrix on
对它赋值为左边幻灯片上的矩阵

121
00:04:22,274 --> 00:04:24,456
the left, type three four
键入3 4 2 16

122
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:28,080
two sixteen, so that's my matrix A right.
这就是我的A矩阵了

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,882
This is matrix 34,
这就是矩阵 3 4

124
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,141
216 that I have down
2 16

125
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,773
here on the left.
也就是左边那个矩阵

126
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,543
And, the software lets me compute
使用这个软件

127
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:36,243
the inverse of A very easily.
我能够很容易得到A的逆矩阵

128
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,110
It's like P over A equals this.
就像这样直接键入pinv(A)

129
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,765
And so, this is right,
这样

130
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:41,935
this matrix here on my
我们得到了结果

131
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:43,715
four minus, on my one, and so on.
0.4 -0.1 等等

132
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,308
This given the numerical
这里得到的是

133
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,794
solution to what is the
A的逆矩阵的近似解

134
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:48,350
inverse of A. So let me
我可以这样写

135
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,538
just write, inverse of A
定义一个变量inverseOFA

136
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,558
equals P inverse of
其值等于 pinv(A)

137
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,232
A over that I
那么inverseOFA的值就是这样

138
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:57,200
can now just verify that A
现在我们可以证明一下

139
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,597
times A inverse the identity
A乘以A的逆矩阵结果是单位矩阵

140
00:04:58,597 --> 00:05:00,644
is, type A times the
键入 A 乘以

141
00:05:00,644 --> 00:05:03,390
inverse of A and
A的逆矩阵

142
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,740
the result of that is
这样得到的结果

143
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,513
this matrix and this is
是这样的一个矩阵

144
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,708
one one on the diagonal
主对角线是1和1

145
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,453
and essentially ten to
副对角线不是1

146
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:11,582
the minus seventeen, ten to the
但是基本上10的-17次方

147
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:13,324
minus sixteen, so Up to
10的-16次方

148
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:14,961
numerical precision, up to
这里由于计算精度的问题

149
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,012
a little bit of round off
由于计算机在寻找最佳结果时

150
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,562
error that my computer
由于进行了四舍五入圆整

151
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:21,123
had in finding optimal matrices
所以产生了一点点误差

152
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:22,623
and these numbers off the
所以这些副对角线上的数字

153
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,948
diagonals are essentially zero
实际上也近似等于0

154
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,078
so A times the inverse is essentially the identity matrix.
因此矩阵A和其逆矩阵相乘的结果就是单位矩阵

155
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,907
Can also verify the inverse of
我们也可以证明

156
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:33,215
A times A is also
A的逆矩阵乘以A

157
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:35,795
equal to the identity,
其结果也是单位矩阵

158
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:38,183
ones on the diagonals and values
主对角线上都是1

159
00:05:38,183 --> 00:05:39,938
that are essentially zero except

所讨论的范畴

171
00:06:02,056 --> 00:06:03,942
intuition you might take away
但有一点

172
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:05,245
that just as the
你能理解的是

173
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,588
number zero doesn't have an
数字0没有倒数

174
00:06:06,588 --> 00:06:08,429
inverse, it turns out
因此

175
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,188
that if A is say the
如果矩阵A中

176
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:13,457

所有元素都为0

177
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:14,791
this matrix A also does
那么这个矩阵A

178
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,432
not have an inverse because there's
依然没有逆矩阵

179
00:06:16,432 --> 00:06:18,033
no matrix there's no A

180
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,821
inverse matrix so that this
能使得这个矩阵

185
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:27,660
are a few other matrices with properties similar to this.

这一点不应成为问题

194
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,260
an issue or more precisely
具体来讲

195
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,389

203
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:59,200
Working with matrices that don't
比如怎样处理

204
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,458
have inverses.
矩阵的逆矩阵不存在的问题

205
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,680
But the intuition if you
不过你至少可以这样理解

206
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:04,275
want is that you can
在某种意义上

207
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:05,808
think of matrices as not
你可以把那些

208
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:07,242
have an inverse that is somehow
没有逆矩阵的矩阵

209
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:10,331
too close to zero in some sense.
想成是非常近似为0

210
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:12,602
So, just to wrap
最后再讲一点

211
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,900
up the terminology, matrix that
逆矩阵不存在的矩阵

212
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,938
don't have an inverse Sometimes called
它的专有名词是

213
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,835
a singular matrix or degenerate
奇异矩阵

214
00:07:18,835 --> 00:07:20,960
matrix and so this
或者叫退化矩阵

215
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,560
matrix over here is an
因此这里这个矩阵

216
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,701
example zero zero zero matrix.
这个零矩阵

217
00:07:24,701 --> 00:07:29,491
is an example of a matrix that is singular, or a matrix that is degenerate.
就是一个奇异矩阵 或者说退化矩阵的例子

218
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:31,348
Finally, the last special
最后 还有一种矩阵运算

219
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,652
matrix operation I want to
我想给大家介绍的

220
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:34,520
tell you about is to do matrix transpose.
是矩阵的转置运算

221
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,369
So suppose I have
假设我们有矩阵A

222
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,160
matrix A, if I compute
那么A的转置矩阵

223
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,220
the transpose of A, that's what I get here on the right.
可以写成右边这个矩阵

224
00:07:41,232 --> 00:07:43,156
This is a transpose which is
这就是矩阵A的转置矩阵

225
00:07:43,156 --> 00:07:46,275
written and A superscript T,
写法是A加上一个上标的T

226
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:47,363
and the way you compute
计算转置矩阵的方法

227
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,531
the transpose of a matrix is as follows.
如下所示

228
00:07:49,531 --> 00:07:50,628
To get a transpose I am going
要得到转置矩阵

229
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:52,276
to first take the first
首先我取出A矩阵的第一行

230
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,079
row of A one to zero.
1 2 0

231
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,791
That becomes this first column of this transpose.
它们将成为转置矩阵的第一列

232
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,762
And then I'm going to take
接下来

233
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,050
the second row of A,
我再取出矩阵A的第二行

234
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,610
3 5 9, and that becomes the second column.
3 5 9

235
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,838
of the matrix A transpose.
它们将成为转置矩阵的第二列

236
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,131
And another way of
你也可以这样想

237
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,296
thinking about how the computer transposes
求解转置矩阵

238
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:11,569
is as if you're taking this
实际上可以看作

239
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,671
sort of 45 degree axis
画一条45度的斜线

240
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:16,349
and you are mirroring or you
然后你以这条线求镜像

241
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,698
are flipping the matrix along that 45 degree axis.
或者以这条45度线为轴进行翻转

242
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:23,488
so here's the more formal
因此我们可以得到

243
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,522
definition of a matrix transpose.
关于矩阵转置的正式定义

244
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:30,688
Let's say A is a m by n matrix.
假设矩阵A是一个m行n列的矩阵

245
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,727
And let's let B equal A
并且假设矩阵B等于A的转置

246
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:36,371
transpose and so BA transpose like so.
就像这样

247
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:37,563
Then B is going to
那么B将是一个

248
00:08:37,563 --> 00:08:39,637
be a n by m matrix
n行m列的矩阵

249
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:42,752
with the dimensions reversed so
两个矩阵的维度是相反的

250
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,308
here we have a 2x3 matrix.
这里我们的A矩阵是2行3列的

251
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,050
And so the transpose becomes a
那么A的转置矩阵B

252
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,196
3x2 matrix, and moreover,
将是一个3行2列的矩阵

253
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,585
the BIJ is equal to AJI.
此外 Bij等于Aji

254
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,030
So the IJ element of this
也就是说

255
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,390
matrix B is going to be
矩阵B的ij元素

256
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,913
the JI element of that
是等于A矩阵的ji元素

257
00:08:59,913 --> 00:09:02,310
earlier matrix A. So for
我们来举个例子

258
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,212
example, B 1 2
B12这个元素

259
00:09:04,212 --> 00:09:06,997
is going to be equal
将等于

260
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,756
to, look at this
请看这个矩阵

261
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,537
matrix, B 1 2 is going to be equal to
B12元素将等于

262
00:09:10,537 --> 00:09:13,775
this element 3 1st row, 2nd column.
A矩阵中 第一行第二列的元素3

263
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,008
And that equal to this, which
那么这个元素

264
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,199
is a two one, second
也就是等于A21

265
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,412
row first column, right, which
A矩阵中第二行第一列的元素

266
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,421
is equal to two and some
也就是2

267
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,860
of the example B 3
再举个例子

268
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,561
2, right, that's B
B32这个元素

269
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:30,922
3 2 is this element 9,
也就是9

270
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,282
and that's equal to
是等于

271
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:35,525
a two three which is
A23这个元素

272
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,963
this element up here, nine.
也就是这个元素 也是等于9的

273
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:40,433
And so that wraps up
好的

274
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:41,893
the definition of what it
这样我们就介绍了

275
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:43,468
means to take the transpose
怎样求一个矩阵的转置矩阵

276
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,991
of a matrix and that
以及它的正式定义

277
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:49,323
in fact concludes our linear algebra review.
