00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,870
about how to use back propagation
我们谈到了怎样使用反向传播算法

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,810
to compute the derivatives of your cost function.
计算代价函数的导数

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,770
In this video, I want

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,110
unrolling your parameters from
怎样把你的参数

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,500
matrices into vectors, which we
从矩阵展开成向量

8
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,870
need in order to use the advanced optimization routines.
以便我们在高级最优化步骤中的使用需要

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,470
Concretely, let's say
具体来讲

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,120
you've implemented a cost function
你执行了代价函数costFunction

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,870
that takes this input, you know, parameters
输入参数是theta

12
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,690
theta and returns the cost function and returns derivatives.
函数返回值是代价函数以及导数值

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,260
Then you can pass this to
然后你可以将返回值

an advanced authorization algorithm by fminunc
传递给高级最优化算法fminunc

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,790
and fminunc
顺便提醒

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,900
isn't the only one by the way.
fminunc并不是唯一的算法

17
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,660
There are also other advanced authorization algorithms.
你也可以使用别的优化算法

18
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,910

do is take those input
都是取出这些输入值

20
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,560
pointedly the cost function,

and some initial value of theta.
以及theta值的一些初始值

22
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,490
And both, and these
并且这些程序

23
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,600
routines assume that theta and
都假设theta

24
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,360
the initial value of theta, that
和这些theta初始值

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,410
these are parameter vectors, maybe
都是参数向量

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,040
Rn or Rn plus 1.
也许是n或者n+1阶

27
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,440
But these are vectors and it
但它们都是向量

28
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,880
also assumes that, you know, your cost
同时假设这个代价函数

29
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,770
function will return as
第二个返回值

30
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,640
a second return value this
也就是gradient值

31
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,410
gradient which is also Rn
也是n阶或者n+1阶

32
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,860
and Rn plus 1. So also a vector.
所以它也是一个向量

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,890
This worked fine when we
这部分在我们使用逻辑回归的时候

34
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,030
were using logistic progression but
运行顺利

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,120
now that we're using a neural
但现在 对于神经网络

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,160
network our parameters are
我们的参数将不再是

37
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,370

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,890
Well, in the previous video we
那么在之前的视频中

46
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,430
showed how to compute these
我们演示了如何计算

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,520

它们是D(1) D(2) D(3)

49
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,950
capital D3, which we
在Octave中

50
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,130
might represent an octave as matrices D1, D2, D3.
我们用矩阵D1 D2 D3来表示

51
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,150
In this video I want
在这节视频中

52
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,420
to quickly tell you about the
我想很快地向你介绍

53
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,480
idea of how to take
怎样取出这些矩阵

54
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,060
these matrices and unroll them into vectors.
并且将它们展开成向量

55
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,750
So that they end up
以便它们最终

56
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,790
being in a format suitable for
成为恰当的格式

57
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,090
passing into as theta here off for getting
能够传入这里的Theta

58
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,850
out for a gradient there.
并且得到正确的梯度返回值gradient

59
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,540
Concretely, let's say we
具体来说

60
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,740
have a neural network with one
假设我们有这样一个神经网络

61
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,250
input layer with ten units,
其输入层有10个输入单元

62
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,000
hidden layer with ten units
隐藏层有10个单元

63
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,870
and one output layer with
最后的输出层

64
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,090
just one unit, so s1
只有一个输出单元

65
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,030
is the number of units in layer one
因此s1等于第一层的单元数

66
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,710
and s2 is the
s2等于第二层的单元数

67
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,220
number of units in layer two, and s3 is a number
s3等于第三层的

68
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,700
of units in layer three.
单元个数

69
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,200
In this case, the dimension of
在这种情况下

70
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,240
your matrices theta and
矩阵θ的维度

71
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,380
D are going to be
和矩阵D的维度

72
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,110
given by these expressions.
将由这些表达式确定

73
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,300
For example, theta one
比如说

74
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,220
is going to a 10 by 11 matrix and so on.
θ(1)是一个10x11的矩阵 以此类推

75
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,740
So in if you want
因此 在Octave中

76
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,960
to convert between these matrices.
如果你想将这些矩阵

77
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:38,580
vectors.
转化为向量

78
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,590
What you can do is take
那么你要做的

79
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,130
your theta 1, theta
是取出你的Theta1 Theta2

80
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,220
2, theta 3, and write this
Theta3

81
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,470
piece of code and this will
然后使用这段代码

82
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,820
take all the elements of
这段代码将取出

83
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,540
your three theta matrices and
三个θ矩阵中的所有元素

84
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,400
take all the elements
也就是说取出Theta1

85
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,150
of theta one, all the
的所有元素

86
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,290
elements of theta 2, all the
Theta2的所有元素

87
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
elements of theta 3,
Theta3的所有元素

88
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,510
and unroll them and put
然后把它们全部展开

89
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,420
all the elements into a big long vector.
成为一个很长的向量

90
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,880
Which is thetaVec and similarly
也就是thetaVec

91
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,510
the second command would take
同样的 第二段代码

92
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,350
all of your D matrices and
将取出D矩阵的所有元素

93
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,600
unroll them into a big
然后展开

94
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,340
long vector and call them
成为一个长向量

95
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,810
DVec. And finally
被叫做DVec

96
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,330
if you want to go back from
最后 如果你想从向量表达

97
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,380
the vector representations to the matrix representations.
返回到矩阵表达式的话

98
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,630
What you do to get back
你要做的是

99
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,720
to theta one say is take
比如想再得到Theta1

100
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,250
thetaVec and pull
那么取thetaVec

101
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,980
out the first 110 elements.
抽出前110个元素

102
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,930
So theta 1 has 110
因此

103
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,650
elements because it's a
Theta1就有110个元素

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,420
10 by 11 matrix so that
因为它应该是一个10x11的矩阵

105
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,200
pulls out the first 110 elements
所以 抽出前110个元素

106
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,200
and then you can
然后你就能使用

107
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:32,960
use the reshape command to reshape those back into theta 1.
reshape矩阵变维命令来重新得到Theta1

108
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,730
And similarly, to get
同样类似的

109
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,850
back theta 2 you pull
要重新得到Theta2矩阵

110
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,010
out the next 110 elements and reshape it.
你需要抽出下一组110个元素并且重新组合

111
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,410
And for theta 3, you pull out
然后对于Theta3

112
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,320
the final eleven elements and run
你需要抽出最后11个元素

113
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,210
reshape to get back the theta 3.
然后执行reshape命令 重新得到Theta3

114
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,700
Here's a quick Octave demo of that process.
以下是这一过程的Octave演示

115
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,370
So for this example
对于这一个例子

116
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,530
let's set theta 1 equal
让我们假设Theta1

117
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,440
to be ones of 10 by
为一个10x11的单位矩阵

118
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,580
11, so it's a matrix of all ones. And
因此它每一项都为1

119
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,400
just to make this easier seen,
为了更易看清

120
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,060
let's set that to be 2
让我们把Theta2设为

121
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,150
times ones, 10 by
一个10行11列矩阵

122
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,390
11 and let's
每个元素都为2

123
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,570
set theta 3 equals 3
然后设Theta3 是一个1x11的矩阵

124
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,110
times 1's of 1 by 11.
每个元素都为3

125
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,680
So this is 3
因此 这样我们得到三个独立的矩阵

126
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,030
separate matrices: theta 1, theta 2, theta 3.
Theta1 Theta2 Theta3

127
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,010
We want to put all of these as a vector.
现在我们想把所有这些矩阵变成一个向量

128
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,740
ThetaVec equals theta
thetaVec =

129
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,660
1; theta 2
[Theta1(:); Theta2(:); Theta3(:)];

130
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:28,990
theta 3.
好的

131
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,060
Right, that's a colon
注意中间有冒号

132
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,220
in the middle and like so
像这样

133
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,420
and now thetavec is
现在thetaVec矩阵

134
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:40,090
going to be a very long vector.
就变成了一个很长的向量

135
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,910
That's 231 elements.
含有231个元素

136
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,000
If I display it, I find
如果把它打出来

137
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,640
that this very long vector with
我们就能看出它是一个很长的向量

138
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,610
all the elements of the first
包括第一个矩阵的所有元素

139
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,630
matrix, all the elements of
第二个矩阵的所有元素

140
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,360
the second matrix, then all the elements of the third matrix.
以及第三个矩阵的所有元素

141
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,450
And if I want to get back
如果我想重新得到

142
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,420
my original matrices, I can
我最初的三个矩阵

143
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,040
do reshape thetaVec.
我可以对thetaVec使用reshape命令

144
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,580
Let's pull out the first 110
抽出前110个元素

145
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,640
elements and reshape them to a 10 by 11 matrix.
将它们重组为一个10x11的矩阵

146
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,240
This gives me back theta 1.
这样我又再次得到了Theta1矩阵

147
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,770
And if I then pull
然后我再取出

148
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,220
out the next 110 elements.
接下来的110个元素

149
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,690
So that's indices 111 to 220.
也就是111到220号元素

150
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,470
I get back all of my 2's.
我就又重组还原了第二个矩阵

151
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,330
And if I go
最后

152
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,110
from 221 up to
再抽出221到最后一个元素

153
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,240
the last element, which is
也就是第231个元素

154
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,970
element 231, and reshape to
然后重组为1x11的矩阵

155
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,130
1 by 11, I get back theta 3.
我就又得到了Theta3矩阵

156
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,110
To make this process really concrete,
为了使这个过程更形象

157
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,750
here's how we use the unrolling
