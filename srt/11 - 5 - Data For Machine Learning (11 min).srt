词是“两个” (two)

150
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,640
is not word TO and its not the word TOO. So
而不是单词 to 或 too

151
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,270
the features capture, you know, one
因此特征捕捉

152
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,390

this two together imply is

281
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,630
that hopefully the test set error

282
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,450
will also be small.
也会很小

283
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,610
Another way to

284
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,930
think about this is that

it not to have high bias and not to have high variance.

288
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,270
So the bias problem we're going

289
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,700
to address by making sure we
通过确保

290
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,910
have a learning algorithm with many

291
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,670
parameters and so that

gives us a low bias alorithm

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,240
very large training set, this ensures

295
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,590
that we don't have a variance problem here.

297
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,100
have no variance and so
没有方差 并且

298
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,940
is by pulling these two together,
通过将这两个值放在一起

299
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,830
that we end up with a low
我们最终可以得到一个低

300

bias and a low variance

301
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,920

allows us to do well
使得我们能够

303
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,150
on the test set.
很好地测试测试数据集

304
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:12,140
And fundamentally it's a key ingredients
从根本上来说 这是一个关键

305
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,560
of assuming that the features
的假设：特征值

306
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,750
have enough information and we
有足够的信息量 且我们

307
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,960
have a rich class of functions
有一类很好的函数

308
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,580
that's why it guarantees low bias,
这是为什么能保证低误差的关键所在

309
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,750
and then it having a massive
它有大量的

310
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,010
training set that that's what guarantees more variance.
训练数据集 这能保证得到更多的方差值

311
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,310
So this gives us a
因此这给我们提出了

312
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,820
set of conditions rather hopefully
一些可能的条件

313
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,610

317
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,930
algorithm with lot of parameters, that might

318
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,870
be a good way to give
