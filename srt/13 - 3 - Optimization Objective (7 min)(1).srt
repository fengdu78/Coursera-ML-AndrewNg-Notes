1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,540
Most of the supervised learning algorithms
在大多数我们已经学到的（字幕翻译：中国海洋大学，黄海广，haiguang2000@qq.com）

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,890
we've seen, things like linear
监督学习算法中，类似于线性回归

3
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,730
regression, logistic regression and
逻辑回归，以及更多的算法

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,850
so on. All of those
所有的这些

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,089
algorithms have an optimization objective
算法都有一个优化目标函数

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,920
or some cost function that the algorithm was trying to minimize.
或者某个代价函数需要通过算法进行最小化

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,180
It turns out that K-means also
事实上 K均值也有

8
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,730
has an optimization objective or
一个优化目标函数或者

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,720
a cost function that is trying to minimize.
需要最小化的代价函数

10
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,180
And in this video, I'd like to tell
在这个视频中 我会

11
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,620
you what that optimization objective is.
告诉大家这个优化目标函数是什么

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,420
And the reason I want to do so
我这么做有两方面的目的

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,960
is because this will be useful to us for two purposes.
具体来说

14
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,330
First, knowing what is the
首先 了解什么是

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,890
optimization objective of K-means
K均值的优化目标函数

16
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,390
will help us to
这将能帮助我们

17
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,970
debug the learning algorithm and
调试学习算法

18
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,080
just make sure that K-means is
确保K均值算法

19
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,100
running correctly, and second,
是在正确运行中

20
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,290
and perhaps even more importantly, in
第二个也是最重要的一个目的是

21
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,290
a later video we'll talk
在之后的视频中我们将讨论

22
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:42,580
about how we can use this to
我们该怎样运用这个来

23
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,000
help K-means find better clusters
帮助K均值找到更好的簇

24
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,290
and avoid local optima, but we'll do that in a later video that follows this one.
并且避免局部最优解，不过我们在这节课之后的视频中才会涉及到

25
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,330
Just as a quick reminder, while K-means is
另外顺便提一下 当K均值正在运行时

26
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,870
running we're going to be
我们将

27
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,820
keeping track of two sets of variables.
对两组变量进行跟踪

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,390
First is the CI's and
首先是 c(i)

29
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,830
that keeps track of the
它表示的是

30
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,600
index or the number of the cluster
当前的样本 x(i) 所归为

31
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,040
to which an example x(i) is currently assigned.
的那个簇的索引或者序号

32
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:05,960
And then, the other set of variables
另外一组变量

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,580
we use as Mu subscript
我们用 μk 来表示

34
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,410
K, which is the location
第 k 个簇的

35
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,110
of cluster centroid K. And,
聚类中心 (cluster centroid)

36
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,750
again, for K-means
顺便再提一句

37
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,230
we use capital K to denote the total number of clusters.
K均值中我们用大写 K

38
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,310
And here lower case K,
来表示簇的总数

39
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,910
you know, is going to be an
用小写 k 来表示

40
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,650
index into the cluster
聚类中心的序号

41
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,930
centroids, and so lower
因此

42
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:24,940
case k is going to be
小写 k 的范围

43
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,390
a number between 1 and
就应该是1到大写K之间

44
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,630
capital K. Now, here's
除此以外

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,040
one more bit of notation which
还有另一个符号

46
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,280
is going to use Mu
我们用 μc(i)

47
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:34,560
subscript c(i) to denote
来表示

48
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,660
the cluster centroid of the
x(i) 所属的那个簇

49
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,400
cluster to which example x(i)
的聚类中心

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,500
has been assigned and
我再稍微多解释一下

51
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,030
to explain that notation
这个符号

52
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,450
a little bit more, let's
假如说

53
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,600
say that x(i) has been
x(i) 被划为了

54
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,760
assigned to cluster number five.
第5个簇

55
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,830
What that means is that c(i),
这是什么意思呢？

56
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,290
that is the index of x(i),
这个意思是 x(i) 的序号

57
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,300
that that is equal to 5.
也就是 c(i) 等于5

58
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,640
Right? Because you know, having c(i) equals 5,
因为 c(i) = 5

59
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,270
that's what it means for the
表示的就是

60
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,720
example x(i) to be
x(i) 这个样本

61
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,440
assigned to cluster number 5.
被分到了第五个簇

62
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,700
And so Mu subscript
因此

63
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,960
c(i) is going to
μ 下标 c(i)

64
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,630
be equal to Mu subscript
就等于  μ5

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,260
5 because c(i) is equal
因为 c(i) 就是5

66
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,100
to 5.
所以

67
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,570
This Mu substitute c(i) is the
这里的 μc(i)

68
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,420
cluster centroid of cluster number
就是第5个簇的聚类中心

69
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,670
5, which is the cluster
而也正是我的样本 x(i)

70
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,480
to which my example x(i) has been assigned.
所属的第5个簇

71
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,730
With this notation, we're now
有了这样的符号表示

72
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,040
ready to write out what
现在我们就能写出

73
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,150
is the optimization objective of
K均值聚类算法的

74
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,360
the K Mu clustering algorithm.
优化目标了

75
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:30,800
And here it is.
以下便是

76
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,940
The cost function that K-means
K均值算法需要

77
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,380
is minimizing is the
最小化的代价函数

78
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,770
function J of all of
J 参数是 c(1) 到 c(m)

79
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,470
these parameters c1 through
以及 μ1 到 μk

80
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,610
cM, Mu1 through MuK, that
随着算法的执行过程

81
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,570
K-means is varying as the algorithm runs.
这些参数将不断变化

82
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,930
And the optimization objective is shown
右边给出了优化目标

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,520
on the right, is the average of
也就是所有的

84
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,430
one over M of the sum
1/m 乘以

85
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,730
of i equals one through M of this term here
i = 1 到 m 个项的求和

86
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,670
that I've just drawn the red box around.
这里我用红色框出了这部分

87
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,680
The squared distance between
也即每个样本 x(i)

88
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,540
each example x(i) and the
到 x(i) 所属的

89
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,740
location of the cluster
聚类簇的中心

90
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,210
centroid to which x(i)
距离的平方值

91
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,920
has been assigned.
被分配

92
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,070
So let me just draw this in, let me explain this.
我来解释一下

93
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,800
Here is the location of training
这是训练样本 x(i) 的位置

94
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,780
example x(i), and here's the location
这是 x(i) 这个样本被划分到的

95
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,760
of the cluster centroid to which
聚类簇的中心的位置

96
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,660
example x(i) has been assigned.
我们在图上解释一下

97
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,080
So to explain this in pictures, if here is X1, X2.
如果这是 x1 x2

98
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,540
And if a point
并且如果这个点

99
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,210
here, is my example
是我的第 i 个样本

100
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,060
x(i), so if that
x(i) 那么

101
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,840
is equal to my example x(i),
也就是说这个值等于 x(i)

102
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,000
and if x(i) has been assigned
并且 x(i) 被分到了

103
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,270
to some cluster centroid, and
某一个聚类中心

104
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,240
I'll denote my cluster centroid with a cross.
我用一个叉来表示这个聚类中心

105
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,130
So if that's the location of,
所以 如果我们假设

106
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,830
you know, Mu 5, let's
这个聚类中心是 μ5

107
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,640
say, if x(i) has been
也就是说 假如 x(i)

108
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,960
assigned to cluster centroid 5 in my example up there.
被分到第五个聚类簇

109
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,660
Then, the squared distance, that's
那么这个距离平方值

110
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,840
the squared of the distance
也就是点 x(i)

111
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,010
between the point x(i) and this
和 x(i) 被分配到的聚类中心的

112
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,400
cluster centroid, to which x(i) has been assigned.
距离的平方值

113
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:50,720
And what K-means can be shown
那么 K均值算法

114
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,540
to be doing is that, it
要做的事情就是

115
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
is trying to find parameters c(i)
它将找到参数 c(i) 和 μi

116
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,410
and Mu(i), try to
并且

117
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,840
find cMU to try to
找到能够最小化

118
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,450
minimize this cost function J.
代价函数J的cμ

119
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,180
This cost function is sometimes
这个代价函数

120
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,770
also called the distortion cost
在K均值算法中

121
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,030
function or the distortion of
有时候也叫做

122
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,130
the K-means algorithm.
失真代价函数(distortion cost function)

123
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,360
And, just to provide a little bit more
再解释详细点

124
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,750
detail, here's the K-means algorithm,
这是K均值算法

125
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,450
Here's exactly the algorithm as we have it, in the real
这跟我们之前得到的

126
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,960
form the earlier slide.
算法是一样的

127
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,200
And what this first step
这个算法的第一步

128
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,120
of this algorithm is, this was
就是聚类中心的分配

129
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,910
the cluster assignment step
在这一步中

130
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,850
where we assign each
我们要把每一个点

131
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,910
point to the cluster centroid, and
划分给各自所属的聚类中心

132
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:34,830
it's possible to show mathematically that
可以用数学证明

133
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,210
what the cluster assignment step
这个聚类簇的划分步骤

134
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,560
is doing is exactly minimizing
实际上就是在

135
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,950
J with respect
对代价函数 J 进行最小化

136
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,900
to the variables, C1, C2
关于参数 c(1) c(2)

137
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,050
and so on, up
等等

138
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,030
to C(m), while holding the
一直到 c(m)

139
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,240
closest centroids, MU1 up to
而保持最近的聚类中心 μ1

140
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,000
MUK fixed.
到 μk 固定不变

141
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,640
So, what the first assignment step
因此 第一步要做的

142
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,990
does is you know, it doesn't change
其实不是改变

143
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,850
the cluster centroids, but what it's
聚类中心的位置

144
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,730
doing is, exactly picking the values of C1, C2, up to CM
而是选择 c(1) c(2) 一直到 c(m)

145
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,240
that minimizes the cost
来最小化这个代价函数

146
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,790
function or the distortion function,
或者说失真函数 J

147
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:14,440
J. And it's possible to prove
不难从数学的角度证明

148
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,550
that mathematically but, I won't do so here.
但我在这里就不做了

149
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,210
That has a pretty intuitive meaning
有一个很直观的意义，

150
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,630
of just, yo know, well let's assign
只是，你知道的，那么让我们将

151
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,040
these points to the cluster centroid
这些点到聚类中心

152
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,820
that is closest to it, because
使之最接近它，因为

153
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,160
that's what minimizes the square
这是最小平方距离的点

154
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,860
of distance between the points and the corresponding cluster centroid.
和相应的聚类中心之间。

155
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,090
And then the other part of
然后

156
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,880
the second step of K-means, this second step over here.
K-均值算法的第二步

157
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,480
