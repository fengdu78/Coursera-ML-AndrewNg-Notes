In this video, what I'd like
在这段视频中

5
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,090
to do is try to
我想结合我们所讲的

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,040
put all the pieces together, to
所有这些内容

7
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,120
give a overall summary or
来做一个总体的回顾

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,410
a bigger picture view, of how
看看这些零散的内容

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,290
all the pieces fit together and
相互之间有怎样的联系

10
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,990
of the overall process of how
以及神经网络学习算法的

11
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,830
to implement a neural network learning algorithm.
总体实现过程

12
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,210
When training a neural network, the
当我们在训练一个神经网络时

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,290
first thing you need to do
我们要做的第一件事

14
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,920
is pick some network architecture
就是搭建网络的大体框架

15
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,950
and by architecture I just
这里我说的框架 意思是

16
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,510
mean connectivity pattern between the neurons.
神经元之间的连接模式

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,840
So, you know, we might choose
我们可能会从以下几种结构中选择

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,770
between say, a neural network
第一种神经网络的结构是

19
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:35,440
with three input units
包含三个输入单元

20
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,400
and five hidden units and
五个隐藏单元

21
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,560
four output units versus one
和四个输出单元

22
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,460
of 3, 5 hidden, 5
第二种结构是 三个输入单元作为输入层

23
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,430
hidden, 4 output and
两组五个隐藏单元作为隐藏层 四个输出单元的输出层

24
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,220
here are 3, 5,
然后第三种是3 5 5 5

25
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,060
5, 5 units in each
其中每个隐藏层包含五个单元

26
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,870
of three hidden layers and four
然后是四个输出单元

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,250
open units, and so these
这些就是可能选择的结构

28
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,000
choices of how many hidden
每一层可以选择

29
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,410
units in each layer
多少个隐藏单元

30
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,560
and how many hidden layers, those
以及可以选择多少个隐藏层

31
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,580
are architecture choices.
这些都是你构建时的选择

32
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,680
So, how do you make these choices?
那么我们该如何做出选择呢？

33
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,270
Well first, the number
首先 我们知道

34
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,840
of input units well that's pretty well defined.
我们已经定义了输入单元的数量

35
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,960
And once you decides on the fix
一旦你确定了特征集x

36
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:07,870
set of features x the
对应的输入单元数目

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,420
number of input units will just be, you know, the
也就确定了

38
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,180
dimension of your features x(i)
也就是等于特征x{i}的维度

39
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,470
would be determined by that.
输入单元数目将会由此确定

40
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,970
And if you are doing multiclass
如果你正在进行

41
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,370
classifications the number of
多类别分类

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,320
output of this will be
那么输出层的单元数目

43
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,720
determined by the number
将会由你分类问题中

44
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,860
of classes in your classification problem.
所要区分的类别个数确定

45
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,890
And just a reminder if you have
值得提醒的是

46
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,290
a multiclass classification where y
如果你的多元分类问题

47
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,970
takes on say values between
y的取值范围

48
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,350
1 and 10, so that
是在1到10之间

49
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,560
you have ten possible classes.
那么你就有10个可能的分类

50
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,200
Then remember to right, your
别忘了把你的y

51
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,340
output y as these were the vectors.
重新写成向量的形式

52
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,560
So instead of clause one, you
所以现在我们的y不是一个数了

53
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,840
recode it as a vector
我们重新把y写成

54
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,600
like that, or for
这种形式的向量

55
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,280
the second class you recode it as a vector like that.
第二个分类我们可以写成这样的向量

56
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,080
So if one of these
所以 比如说

57
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,000
apples takes on
如果要表达

58
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,910
the fifth class, you know, y equals 5, then
第五个分类 也就是说y等于5

59
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,130
what you're showing to your neural
那么在你的神经网络中

60
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,840
network is not actually a value
就不能直接用

61
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,520
of y equals 5, instead here
数值5来表达

62
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:00,950
at the upper layer which would
因为这里的输出层

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,650
have ten output units, you
有十个输出单元

64
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,920
will instead feed to the
你应该用一个向量

65
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,710
vector which you know
来表示

66
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,430
with one in the fifth
这个向量的第五个位置值是1

67
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,050
position and a bunch of zeros down here.
其它的都是0

68
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,470
So the choice of number
所以对于输入单元

69
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,330
of input units and number of output units
和输出单元数目的选择

70
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,600
is maybe somewhat reasonably straightforward.
还是比较容易理解的

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,950
And as for the number
那么对于隐藏层

72
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,040
of hidden units and the
单元的个数

73
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,110
number of hidden layers, a
以及隐藏层的数目

74
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,350
reasonable default is to
我们有一个默认的规则

75
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,010
use a single hidden layer
那就是只使用单个隐藏层

76
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,040
and so this type of
所以最左边所示的

77
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,400
neural network shown on the left with
这种只有一个隐藏层的神经网络

78
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,270
just one hidden layer is probably the most common.
一般来说是最普遍的

79
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,870
Or if you use more
或者如果你使用

80
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,410
than one hidden layer, again the
不止一个隐藏层的话

81
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,600
reasonable default will be to
同样我们也有一个默认规则

82
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,950
have the same number of
那就是每一个隐藏层

83
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,560
hidden units in every single layer.
通常都应有相同的单元数

84
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,600
So here we have two
所以对于这个结构

85
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,370
hidden layers and each
我们有两个隐藏层

86
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,650
of these hidden layers have the
每个隐藏层都有相同的单元数

87
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,500
same number five of hidden
都是5个隐藏单元

88
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,740
units and here we have, you know,
这里也是一样

89
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,020
three hidden layers and
我们有三个隐藏层

90
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,790
each of them has the same
每个隐藏层有相同的单元数

91
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,400
number, that is five hidden units.
都是5个隐藏单元

92
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Rather than doing this sort
但实际上通常来说

93
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,850
of network architecture on the left would be a perfect ably reasonable default.
左边这个结构是较为合理的默认结构

94
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,780
And as for the number
而对于隐藏单元的个数

95
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,040
of hidden units - usually, the
通常情况下

96
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,100
more hidden units the better;
隐藏单元越多越好

97
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,640
it's just that if you have
不过 我们需要注意的是

98
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,110
a lot of hidden units, it
如果有大量隐藏单元

99
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,150
can become more computationally expensive, but
计算量一般会比较大

100
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,850
very often, having more hidden units is a good thing.
当然 一般来说隐藏单元还是越多越好

101
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,560
And usually the number of hidden
并且一般来说 每个隐藏层

102
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,820
units in each layer will be maybe
所包含的单元数量

103
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,130
comparable to the dimension
还应该和输入x

104
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,670
of x, comparable to the
的维度相匹配

105
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,950
number of features, or it could
也要和特征的数目匹配

106
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,880
be any where from same number
可能隐藏单元的数目

107
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,590
of hidden units of input features to
和输入特征的数量相同

108
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,430
maybe so that three or four times of that.
或者是它的二倍 或者三倍 四倍

109
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,770
So having the number of hidden units is comparable.
因此 隐藏单元的数目需要和其他参数相匹配

110
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,350
You know, several times, or
一般来说

111
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,380
some what bigger than the number
隐藏单元的数目取为稍大于

112
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,750
of input features is often
输入特征数目

113
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,320
a useful thing to do So,
都是可以接受的

114
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,490
hopefully this gives you one
希望这些能够给你

115
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,140
reasonable set of default choices
在选择神经网络结构时

如果你遵循了这些建议

118
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,580
will probably get something that works
你一般会得到比较好的模型结构

Next, here's what we
下面我们就来具体介绍

130
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,740
need to implement in order to

actually six steps that I
这里一共有六个步骤

133
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,030
have; I have four on this

slide and two more steps
剩下的两步

135
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,480
on the next slide.
放在下一张幻灯片中

136
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,220
First step is to set up the neural
首先 第一步是构建一个

137
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,510
network and to randomly
神经网络

138
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,570
initialize the values of the weights.
然后随机初始化权值

139
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,000
And we usually initialize the
通常我们把权值

140
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,710
weights to small values near zero.
初始化为很小的值 接近于零

141
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,120
Then we implement forward propagation
然后我们执行前向传播算法

142
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,060
so that we can input
也就是 对于该神经网络的

143
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,150
any excellent neural network and
任意一个输入x(i)

144
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,860
compute h of x which is this
计算出对应的h(x)值

145
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,820
output vector of the y values.
也就是一个输出值y的向量

146
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,910
We then also implement code to
接下来我们通过代码

147
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,500
compute this cost function j of theta.
计算出代价函数J(θ)

148
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,160
And next we implement
然后我们执行

149
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,330
back-prop, or the back-propagation
反向传播算法

150
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,680
algorithm, to compute these
来算出这些偏导数 或偏微分项

151
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,000
partial derivatives terms, partial
也就是

152
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,830
derivatives of j of theta
J(θ)关于参数θ的偏微分

153
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,240
with respect to the parameters. Concretely, to implement back prop.
具体来说

154
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,880
Usually we will do that
我们要对所有训练集数据

155
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,460
with a fore loop over the training examples.
使用一个for循环进行遍历

156
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,650
Some of you may have heard of
可能有部分同学之前听说过

157
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,640
advanced, and frankly very
一些比较先进的分解方法

158
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,500
advanced factorization methods where you
可能不需要像这里一样使用

159
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,720
don't have a four-loop over
for循环来对所有

160
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,580
the m-training examples, that the
m个训练样本进行遍历

161
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,900
first time you're implementing back prop
但是 这是你第一次进行反向传播算法

162
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,420
there should almost certainly the four
所以我建议你最好还是

163
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,980
loop in your code,
使用一个for循环来完成程序

164
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,010
where you're iterating over the examples,
对每一个训练样本进行迭代

165
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,760
you know, x1, y1, then so
从x(1) y(1)开始

166
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,510
you do forward prop and
我们对第一个样本进行

167
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,400
back prop on the first
前向传播运算和反向传播运算

168
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,510
example, and then in
然后在第二次循环中

169
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,730
the second iteration of the
同样地对第二个样本

170
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,360
four-loop, you do forward propagation
执行前向传播和反向传播算法

171
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,050
and back propagation on the second example, and so on.
以此类推

172
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,900
Until you get through the final example.
直到最后一个样本

173
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,110
So there should be
因此 在你第一次做反向传播的时候

174
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,250
a four-loop in your implementation
你还是应该用这样的for循环

175
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,180
of back prop, at least the first time implementing it.
来实现这个过程

176
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,160
And then there are frankly
其实实际上

177
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,520
somewhat complicated ways to do
有复杂的方法可以实现

178
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,660
this without a four-loop, but
并不一定要使用for循环

179
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,950
I definitely do not recommend
但我非常不推荐

180
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,340
trying to do that much more
在第一次实现反向传播算法的时候

181
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,420
complicated version the first time you try to implement back prop.
使用更复杂更高级的方法

182
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,920
So concretely, we have a
所以具体来讲 我们对所有的

183
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,200
four-loop over my m-training examples
m个训练样本上使用了for循环遍历

184
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,630
and inside the four-loop we're
在这个for循环里

185
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,300
going to perform fore prop
我们对每个样本执行

186
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,090
and back prop using just this one example.
前向和反向算法

187
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,320
And what that means is that
具体来说就是

188
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,470
we're going to take x(i), and
我们把x(i)

189
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,010
feed that to my input layer,
传到输入层

190
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,370
perform forward-prop, perform back-prop
然后执行前向传播和反向传播

191
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,360
and that will if all of
这样我们就能得到

192
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,840
these activations and all of

network then still

me draw some curly braces
让我画一个大括号

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:32,930
the four-loop, this is in
for循环的范围

201
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,480
octave code of course, but it's more a sequence Java

202
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,350
code, and a four-loop encompasses all this.

00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,050
would then have some other
我们将用别的程序

211
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,430
code and then that will
来计算出

212
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,240
allow us to compute these partial derivative terms.

213
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,450

218
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,080
you now hopefully have code to

compute these partial derivative terms.
计算这些偏导数项的程序了

220
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,030

221
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,420
do is then use gradient

compared the versions computed using

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,340
sure that both of these give you very similar values.

230
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,410

propagation is correct, and is
得到的结果是正确的

233
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,850
then very important that we disable

234
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,710
gradient checking, because the gradient

checking code is computationally very slow.
因为梯度检查的计算非常慢

236
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,880

280
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,190
figure that I was using earlier to explain gradient descent.
我们早先时候解释梯度下降时的思路

281
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,750
So, we have some cost
我们有某个代价函数

282
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,480
function, and we have
并且在我们的神经网络中

283
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,590
a number of parameters in our neural network. Right
有一系列参数值

284
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,190
here I've just written down two of the parameter values.
这里我只写下了两个参数值

In reality, of course, in

286
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,570
the neural network, we can have lots of parameters with these.
在神经网络里 我们可以有很多的参数值

theta1 theta2 等等 所有的这些都是矩阵 是吧

288
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,130
So we can have very high dimensional
因此我们参数的维度就会很高了

289
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,870
parameters but because of
由于绘图所限 我们不能绘出

the limitations the source of
更高维度情况的图像

291
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,970

that we have only two parameters in this neural network.
这个神经网络中只有两个参数值

293

301
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,170
and so this corresponds to a setting of the parameters.

be pretty close to y(i)
会非常接近于y(i)

307
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,720
and if this is
那么如果是这样的话

308
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,560
true than that's what causes my cost function to be pretty low.
那么我们的代价函数值就会很小

309
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,770
Whereas in contrast, if you were

that was observed in the training set.
也就是我们在训练集观测到的输出值

317
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,480
So points like this on the
因此 像这样的点

318
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,100
line correspond to where the
右边的这个点

319
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,450
hypothesis, where the neural
对应的假设就是

320
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,330
network is outputting values
神经网络的输出值

321
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,810
on the training set that are
在这个训练集上的测试值

322
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,260
far from y(i). So, it's not
应该是远离y(i)的

323
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:57,970
fitting the training set well, whereas
因此这一点对应着对训练集拟合得不好的情况

324
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,640
points like this with low
而像这些点

325
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,300
values of the cost function corresponds
代价函数值很小的点

326
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,380
to where j of theta
对应的J(θ)值

327
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,270
is low, and therefore corresponds
是很小的 因此对应的是

328
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,590
to where the neural network happens
神经网络对训练集数据

329
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,290
to be fitting my training set
拟合得比较好的情况

330
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,340
well, because I mean this is what's
我想表达的是 如果是这种情况的话

331
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,070
needed to be true in order for j of theta to be small.
那么J(θ)的值应该是比较小的

332
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,810
So what gradient descent does is
因此梯度下降算法的原理是

333
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,330
we'll start from some random
我们从某个随机的

334
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,300
initial point like that
初始点开始 比如这一点

335
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,990
one over there, and it will repeatedly go downhill.
它将会不停的往下下降

336
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,400
And so what back propagation is
那么反向传播算法

337
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:27,220
doing is computing the direction
的目的就是算出

338
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,370
of the gradient, and what
梯度下降的方向

339
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,740
gradient descent is doing is
而梯度下降的过程

340
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,060
it's taking little steps downhill
就是沿着这个方向

341
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,220
until hopefully it gets to,
一点点的下降 一直到我们希望得到的点

342
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,410
in this case, a pretty good local optimum.
在这里我们希望找到的就是局部最优点

343
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,250
So, when you implement back
所以 当你在执行反向传播算法

344
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,840
propagation and use gradient
并且使用梯度下降

345
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,420
descent or one of the
或者其他别的什么

346
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,750

some of them do or how all
