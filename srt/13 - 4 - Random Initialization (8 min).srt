lead into a discussion of

talked much about was this step

20
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,210
Here's how I usually initialize my cluster centroids.
这里展示了我通常是如何初始化我的聚类中心的

21
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,710
When running K-means, you should have

22
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,160
the number of cluster centroids, K,
一个聚类中心数值K

23
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,520
set to be less than the
K值要比

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,090
number of training examples M. It
训练样本的数量m小

25
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,210
would be really weird to run

27
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,270
of cluster centroids that's, you know,
聚类中心数值

28
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,790
equal or greater than the number of examples you have, right?
等于或者大于样本数的K均值聚类方法会很奇怪

29
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,010
So the way I
我通常用来

30
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,510
usually initialize K-means is,

32
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,170

33
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,730
I do is then set Mu1
我要做的是设定μ1

34
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,320
of MuK equal to these k examples.
到μk让它们等于这个K个样本

35

Lets say that k is
我们假设 K

37
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,600
equal to 2 and so

38
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:19,520
on this example on the right let's say I want to find two clusters.
就在这个例子的右边 假设我们想找到两个聚类

50
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,230
and that's my second cluster centroid, and

51
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,770
that's one random initialization of K-means.

initialize the cluster centroids.
初始化聚类中心

67

illustrated K-means with the animation.

method of initialization for my cluster centroids.
初始化方法来初始化聚类中心

this slide, this is really the recommended way.

86
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,560
So, as they suggested perhaps

87
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,090
by these two illustrations on the right.

K-means can end up at different solutions.
K均值方法最后可能得到不同的结果

94

95
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,920
If you're given the data sale like this.

97
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,340
are three clusters, and so,

105
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,740
local optima. So, in

106
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,330
this example on the left
有变的这个例子中

107
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,700
it looks like this blue cluster has captured

109
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,810
each is captioned on the relatively small number of points.
每一个聚类都捕捉到了相对较少的点

110
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,480
And so, this corresponds to

111
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,470
a bad local optima because it

112
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,060
has basically taken these two

split it into two

120
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,630
separate sub-clusters like so, and
分别的像这样的小聚类簇

121
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,880
so, both of these
这两个

122
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,970
examples on the lower
右下方的例子

123
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,890

has captured only a single optima example.
只捕捉到了一个最好的样本

128
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,810

129
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
optima, by the way, refers
最优项 顺便提一下 代表

130
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,930
to local optima of this
这个失真函数J

131
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,940

140
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,250
if you're worried about K-means getting
如果你担心K均值方法会遇到

146
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,820
can do, is try multiple, random initializations.
是尝试多次 随机的初始化

147
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,820
So, instead of just initializing K-means

148
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,460
once and hopping that that
就希望它会得到

149
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,680
works, what we can do
