00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,850
Let's get started with our linear algebra review.
我们先复习一下线性代数的知识
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,850
In this video I want to
在这段视频中

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,210
tell you what are matrices and what are vectors.
我会向大家介绍矩阵和向量的概念

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,770
A matrix is a
矩阵是指

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,590
rectangular array of numbers
由数字组成的矩形阵列

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,810
written between square brackets.
并写在方括号中间

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,250
So, for example, here is a
例如

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,180
matrix on the right, a left square bracket.
屏幕中所示的一个矩阵

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,660
And then, write in a bunch of numbers.
先写一个左括号 然后是一些数字

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,100
These could be features from
这些数字可能是

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,660
a learning problem or it could
机器学习问题的特征值

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,740
be data from somewhere else, but
也可能表示其他意思

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,900
the specific values don't matter,
不过现在不用管具体的数字

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,470
and then I'm going to close it with another right bracket on the right.
然后我用右方括号将其括起来

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,440
And so that's one matrix.
这样就得到了一个矩阵

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,520
And, here's another example of
接下来 看一下其他矩阵的例子

17
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,360
the matrix, let's write 3, 4, 5,6.
依次写下1 2 3 4 5 6

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,020
So matrix is just another
因此实际上矩阵

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,630
way for saying, is a
可以说是二维数组的

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,540
2D or a two dimensional array.
另一个名字

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,920
And the other piece
另外

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,320
of knowledge that we need is
我们还需要知道的是

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,740
that the dimension of the
矩阵的

24
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,980
matrix is going to
维度

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,070
be written as the
应该写作

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,750
number of row times the number of columns in the matrix.
矩阵的行数乘以列数

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,190
So, concretely, this example
具体到这个例子

28
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,700
on the left, this
看左边

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,000
has 1, 2, 3, 4
包括1 2 3 4共4行

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,370
rows and has 2 columns,
以及2列

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,950
and so this example on the
因此 这个例子是一个

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,850
left is a 4 by
4 × 2的矩阵

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,320
2 matrix -  number of rows by number of columns.
即行数乘以列数

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,380
So, four rows, two columns.
4行乘2列

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,740
This one on the right, this matrix has two rows.
右边的矩阵有两行

36
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,790
That's the first row, that's
这是第一行

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,580
the second row, and it has three columns.
这是第二行 此外包括三列

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,890
That's the first column, that's the
这是第一列

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,350
second column, that's the third
第二列 第三列

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,340
column So, this second
因此 我们把

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,800
matrix we say it is
这个矩阵称为一个

42
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,660
a 2 by 3 matrix.
2 × 3维的矩阵

43
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,230
So we say that the dimension of this matrix is 2 by 3.
所以我们说这个矩阵的维度是2 × 3维

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,690
Sometimes you also see this
有时候大家会发现

45
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,480
written out, in the case
书写有些不同

46
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,510
of left, you will see this
比如左边的矩阵

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,360
written out as R4 by 2
写成了R4 × 2

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,090
or concretely what people
具体而言

49
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,280
will sometimes say this matrix
大家会将该矩阵称作

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,840
is an element of the set R 4 by 2.
是集合R4×2的元素

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,270
So, this thing here, this
因此

52
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,180
just means the set of all
也就是说

53
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,020
matrices that of dimension
这个矩阵

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,960
4 by 2 and this thing
R4×2代表所有4×2的矩阵的集合

55
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,650
on the right, sometimes this is
而右边的这个矩阵

56
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,800
written out as a matrix that is an R 2 by 3.
有时候也写作一个R2×3的矩阵

57
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,080
So if you ever see, 2 by 3.
因此 如果你看到2×3

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,460
So if you ever see
如果你看到

59
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,700
something like this are 4 by
有些地方表达为

60
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,960
2 or are 2 by 3,
4×2的或者2×3的

61
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,450
people are just referring to
一般都是指

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,830
matrices of a specific dimension.
一个特定维度的矩阵

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,240
Next, let's talk about how
接下来 让我们来谈谈如何

64
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,370
to refer to specific elements of the matrix.
表达矩阵的某个特定元素

65
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,850
And by matrix elements, other than
这里我说矩阵元素

66
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,090
the matrix I just mean
而不是矩阵 我的意思是

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,930
the entries, so the numbers inside the matrix.
矩阵的条目数 也就是矩阵内部的某个数

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,270
So, in the standard notation,
所以 标准的表达是

69
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,110
if A is this
如果A是

70
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,860
matrix here, then A sub-strip
这个矩阵 那么A下标 ij

71
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,050
IJ is going to refer
表示的是

72
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,060
to the i, j entry,
i j对应的那个数字

73
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,490
meaning the entry in
意思是矩阵的第i行和第j列

74
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,690
the matrix in the ith row and jth column.
对应的那个数

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,200
So for example a1-1 is
因此 例如 A11

76
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,660
going to refer to the entry
表示的是第1行

77
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,510
in the 1st row and
第1列所对应的那个元素

78
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,900
the 1st column, so that's the
所以这是

79
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,720
first row and the first
第一行和第一列

80
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,600
column and so a1-1
因此A11

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,920
is going to be equal to
就等于

82
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,880
1, 4, 0, 2.

83
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,620
Another example, 8 1
另一个例子 A12

84
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,020
2 is going to refer to
表示的是

85
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
the entry in the first
第一行第二列

86
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,860
row and the second
对应的那个数

87
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,170
column and so A
所以A12

88
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,000
1 2 is going to be equal to one nine one.
将等于191

89
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,190
This come from a quick examples.
再看一个简单的例子

90
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,360
Let's see, A, oh let's
让我们来看看

91
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,970
say A 3 2, is going to refer
比如说A32 表达的是

92
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,240
to the entry in the 3rd
第3行第2列

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,340
row, and second column,
对应的那个数

94
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,030
right, because that's 3 2
是吧 因为这是3 2

95
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,270
so that's equal to 1 4 3 7.
所以这等于1437

96
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,480
And finally, 8 4 1
最后 A41

97
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,540
is going to refer to
应该等于

98
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
this one right, fourth row,
第四行第一列

99
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,220
first column is equal to
对应的数

100
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,150
1 4 7 and if,
所以是等于 147

101
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,600
hopefully you won't, but if
我希望你不会犯下面的错误

102
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,560
you were to write and say
但如果你这么写的话

103
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,540
well this A 4
如果你写出了A43

104
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,200
3, well, that refers to
这应该表示的是

105
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,130
the fourth row, and the
第四行第三列

106
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,730
third column that, you know,
而你知道

107
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,940
this matrix has no third
这个矩阵没有第三列

108
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,420
column so this is undefined,
因此这是未定义的

109
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,280
you know, or you can think of this as an error.
或者你可以认为这是一个错误

110
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,720
There's no such element as
根本就没有什么A43

111
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,540
8 4 3, so, you know, you
对应的元素 所以

112
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,500
shouldn't be referring to 8 4 3.
你不能写A43

113
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,120
So, the matrix
因此 矩阵

114
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,070
gets you a way of letting
提供了一种很好的方式

115
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,280
you quickly organize, index and access lots of data.
让你快速整理 索引和访问大量数据

116
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,200
In case I seem to be
可能你觉得 我似乎是

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,140
tossing up a lot of
介绍了很多概念

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,110
concepts, a lot of new notations
很多新的符号

119
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,920
very rapidly, you don't need
我讲得很快 你不需要

120
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,230
to memorize all of this, but
把这些都记住

121
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,500
on the course website where we
但在课程网站上

122
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,340
have posted the lecture notes,
我们已经发布了讲义

123
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,960
we also have all of these definitions written down.
所有这些定义都写在讲义里

124
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,740
So you can always refer back,
所以 你可以随时参考

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,200
you know, either to these slides,
包括这些幻灯片

126
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,950
possible coursework, so audible lecture
你可以随时回来观看视频

127
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,060
notes if you forget well, A41 was that?
如果你忘了A41到底是表示什么？

128
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,320
Which row, which column was that?
哪一行 哪一列是什么？

129
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,160
Don't worry about memorizing everything now.
所以现在不要担心记忆问题

130
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,960
You can always refer back to
你可以随时回来参考

131
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,590
the written materials on the course website, and use that as a reference.
课程网站上的材料

132
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,740
So that's what a matrix is.
所以 这就是矩阵的定义

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,000
Next, let's talk about what is a vector.
接下来 让我们来谈谈什么是向量

134
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,400
A vector turns out to be a special case of a matrix.
一个向量是一种特殊的矩阵

135
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,170
A vector is a matrix
向量是只有一列的

136
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,590
that has only 1 column so
矩阵 所以

137
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,650
you have an N x 1
你有一个 n×1

138
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,330
matrix, then that's a remember, right?
矩阵 还记得吗

139
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,970
N is the number of
N是行数

140
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,750
rows, and 1 here
而这里的1

141
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,540
is the number of columns, so, so
表示的是列数 所以

142
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,760
matrix with just one column
只有一列的矩阵

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,730
is what we call a vector.
就是我们所说的向量

144
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,950
So here's an example
因此 这里是一个向量的

145
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,800
of a vector, with I
例子 比如说

146
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,700
guess I have N equals four elements here.
我有 n = 4 个元素

147
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,090
so we also call this
所以我们也把这个称为

148
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,560
thing, another term for
另一个术语是

149
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,300
this is a four dmensional
这是一个四维的

150
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,410
vector, just means that
向量 也就意味着

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,410
this is a vector with four
这是一个含有

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
elements, with four numbers in it.
4个元素的向量

153
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,130
And, just as earlier
而且 前面我们讲

154
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,520
for matrices you saw this
矩阵的时候提到过

155
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,960
notation R3 by 2
这个符号R3×2

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,340
to refer to 2 by
表示的是一个3行2列的矩阵

157
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,770
3 matrices, for this vector
而对于这个向量

158
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,340
we are going to refer to this
我们也同样可以

159
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,270
as a vector in the set R4.
表示为集合R4

160
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,900
So this R4 means a
因此 这个R4是指

161
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,480
set of four-dimensional vectors.
一个四维向量的集合

162
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,230
Next let's talk about how to refer to the elements of the vector.
接下来让我们来谈谈如何引用向量的元素

163
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:02,970
We are going to use the notation
我们将使用符号

164
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,030
yi to refer to
yi来代表

165
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,620
the ith element of the
向量y的第i个元素

166
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,650
vector y. So if y
所以 如果这个向量是y

167
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,470
is this vector, y subscript i is the ith element.
那么y下标i 则表示它的第i个元素

168
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,080
So y1 is the
所以y1表示第一个元素

169
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,320
first element,four sixty, y2

170
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,670
is equal to the second element,
y2表示第二个元素

171
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,030
two thirty two -there's the first.

172
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,780
There's the second.
这是第二个元素

173
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,840
Y3 is equal to
还有y3等于

174
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,380
315 and so on, and
315 等等

175
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,240
only y1 through y4 are
只有y1至y4是有意义的

176
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,600
defined consistency 4-dimensional vector.
因为这定义的是一个四维向量

177
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,990
Also it turns out that
此外 事实上

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,950
there are actually 2 conventions
有两种方法来表达

179
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,590
for how to index into a
某个向量中某个索引

180
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,250
vector and here they are.
是这两种

181
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,020
Sometimes, people will use
有时候 人们会使用

182
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,820
one index and sometimes zero index factors.
1-索引 有时候用0-索引

183
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,620
So this example on the left
因此 左边这个例子

184
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,980
is a one in that
是一个1-索引向量

185
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,240
specter where the element
它的元素写作

186
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,870
we write is y1, y2, y3, y4.
y1 y2 y3 y4

187
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,710
And this example in the right
而右边这个向量

188
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,340
is an example of a zero index
是0-索引的一个例子

189
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,380
factor where we start
我们的索引

190
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,460
the indexing of the elements from zero.
从下标0开始

191
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,620
So the elements go from a zero up to y three.
因此 元素从y0至y3

192
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,170
And this is a bit like the
这有点像

193
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,780
arrays of some primary languages
一些初级语言中的数组

194
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,080
where the arrays can either
数组是从1开始

195
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,740
be indexed starting from one.
排序的

196
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,390
The first element of an
数组的第一个元素

197
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,590
array is sometimes a Y1,
一般时从y1开始

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,480
this is sequence notation I guess,
这是表示序列的符号

199
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,580
and sometimes it's zero index
有时是从0开始排序

200
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,860
depending on what programming language you use.
这取决于你用??什么编程语言

201
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,000
So it turns out that in
所以 事实上

202
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,680
most of math, the one
在数学中

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,390
index version is more
1-索引的情况比较多

204
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,150
common For a lot
而对于很多

205
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,640
of machine learning applications, zero index
机器学习的应用问题来说

206
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,400
vectors gives us a more convenient notation.
0-索引向量为我们提供了一个更方便的符号表达

207
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,650
So what you should usually
所以你通常应该

208
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,580
do is, unless otherwised specified,
做的是 除非特别指定

209
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,070
you should assume we are using one index vectors.
你应该默认我们使用的是1-索引法表示向量

210
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,750
In fact, throughout the rest

explicitly say when we
如果我们需要使用0-索引向量的话

217
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,640
need to switch to, when we
我会明确地告诉你

218
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,760
need to use the zero index
我们什么时候换成

219
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,280
vectors as well.
使用0-索引表达

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,470
Finally, by convention, usually

case to refer to matrices.
来表示矩阵

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,750

like a, b, x, y,
像a b x y

230
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,460
to refer to either numbers,

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,210
this is the more common
我们也经常看到

234
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,610
notation where we use
