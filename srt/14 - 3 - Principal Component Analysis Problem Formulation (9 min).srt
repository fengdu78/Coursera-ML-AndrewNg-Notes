00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,460
something called principal components analysis or PCA.
主成分分析方法(Principal Componet Analysis, PCA）

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,160
It In this video, I would
在这段视频中

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,610
like to start talking about the
我想首先开始讨论

8
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,240
problem formulation for PCA,
PCA问题的公式描述

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,090
in other words let us try
也就是说

10
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,630
to formulate precisely exactly what
我们用公式准确地精确地描述

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,980
we would like PCA to do.
我们想让 PCA 来做什么

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,820
Let's say we have a dataset like
假设 我们有这样的一个数据集

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,050
this, so this is a dataset
这个数据集含有

14
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,710
of example X in R2,
二维实数R^2空间内的样本X

15
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,140
and let's say I want
假设我想

16
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:27,640
to reduce the dimension of the
对数据进行降维

17
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,850
data from two dimensional to one dimensional.
从二维降到一维

18
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,130
In other words I would like to find
也就是说，我想找到

19
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,400
a line onto which to project the data.
一条直线，将数据投影到这条直线上

20
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,680
So what seems like a good line onto which to project the data?
那怎么找到一条好的直线来投影这些数据呢？

21
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,760
A line like this might be a pretty good choice.
这样的一条直线也许是个不错的选择

22
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,790
And the reason you think
你认为

23
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,990
this might be a good choice is
这是一个不错的选择的原因是

24
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,420
that if you look at
如果你观察

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,230
where the projected versions of the points goes.
投影到直线上的点的位置

26
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,180
I'm gonna take this point and project it down here and get that.
我将这个点 投影到直线上 得到这个点

27
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,500
This point gets projected here, to
这点被投影到这里

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,220
here, to here, to here
这里 这里 以及这里

29
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,360
what we find is that the
我们发现

30
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,860
distance between each point
每个点到它们对应的

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,520
and the projected version is pretty small.
投影到直线上的点之间的距离非常小

32
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,490
That is, these blue
也就是说 这些蓝色的

33
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,210
line segments are pretty short.
线段非常的短

34
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,260
So what PCA
所以 正式的说

35
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,730
does, formally, is it tries
PCA所作的就是

36
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,320
to find a lower-dimensional surface
寻找一个低维的面

37
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,250
really a line in
在这个例子中

38
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,660
this case, onto which to
其实是一条直线

39
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,260
project the data, so that
数据投射在上面  使得

40
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,130
the sum of squares of these
这些蓝色小线段的平方和

41
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,570
little blue line segments is minimized.
达到最小化

42
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,780
The length of those blue line
这些蓝色线段的长度

43
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,530
segments, that's sometimes also called
时常被叫做

44
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,710
the projection error, and so what PCA
投影误差

45
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,480
does is it tries to find
所以PCA所做的就是寻找

46
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,840
the surface onto which to
一个投影平面

47
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,350
project the data so as to
对数据进行投影

48
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,050
minimize that. As an a
使得这个能够最小化

49
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,460
side, before applying PCA
另外，在应用PCA之前

50
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,750
it's standard practice to
常规的做法是

51
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,300
first perform mean normalization and
先进行均值归一化和

52
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,190
feature scaling so that the
特征规范化，使得

53
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,760
features, X1 and X2,
特征X1和X2

54
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,770
should have zero mean and
均值为0

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,740
should have comparable ranges of values.
数值在可比较的范围之内

56
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,320
I've already done this for this
在这个例子里，我已经这么做了

57
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,590
example, but I'll come
但是

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,990
back to this later and talk more
在后面，我将回过来，讨论更多的

59
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,960
about feature scaling and mean normalization in the context of PCA later.
PCA背景下的特征规范化和均值归一化问题

60
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,420
Coming back to this example,
回到这个例子

61
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,470
in contrast to the red
对比

62
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,300
lines that I just drew here's
我刚画好的红线

63
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,970
a different line onto which I could project my data.
这是我对数据进行投影的一条不同的直线

64
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,260
This magenta line.
这条品红色的线

65
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,260
And as you can see, you
如你所见

66
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,660
know, this magenta line is a
你知道，这条品红色直线

67
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,920
much worse direction onto which to project my data, right?
是一个非常糟糕的方向来投影我的数据，对吧？

68
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,020
So if I were to project my
所以，如果我将数据

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,430
data onto the magenta
投影到这条品红色的直线上

70
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,050
line, like the other set of points like that.
像我们刚才做的那样

71
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,240
And the projection errors, that
这样，投影误差

72
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,460
is these blue line segments would be huge.
就是这些蓝色的线段，将会很大

73
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,930
So these points have to
所以，这些点将会

74
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,170
move a huge distance in
移动很长一段距离

75
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,840
order to get onto
才能投影到

76
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,760
the, in order to
才能

77
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,440
get projected onto the magenta line.
投影到这条品红色直线上

78
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,390
And so that's why PCA
因此，这就是为什么PCA

79
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,540
principle component analysis would choose
主成分分析方法会选择

80
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,840
something like the red line
红色的这条直线

81
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,410
rather than like the magenta line down here.
而不是品红色的这条直线

82
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,280
Let's write out the PCA problem a little more formally.
我们正式一点地写出PCA问题

83
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,660
The goal of PCA if we
PCA的目标是

84
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,150
want to reduce data from two-
将数据从二维

85
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,580
dimensional to one-dimensional is
降到一维

86
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,160
we're going to try to find
我们将试着寻找

87
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,590
a vector, that is
一个向量

88
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,160
a vector Ui
向量Ui

89
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,250
which is going to be in Rn,
属于Rn空间中的向量

90
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,170
so that would be in R2 in this case,
在这个例子中是R2空间中的

91
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,300
going to find direction onto
寻找一个对数据进行投影的方向

92
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,990
which to project the data so as to minimize the projection error.
使得投影误差能够最小

93
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,710
So in this example I'm
在这个例子里

94
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,180
hoping that PCA will find this
希望PCA寻找到

95
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,590
vector, which I'm going
向量，我将它叫做

96
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,960
to call U1, so that
U1，所以

97
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,340
when I project the data onto
当我把数据投影到

98
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,620
the line that I defined
我定义的这条直线

99
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,840
by extending out this vector,
通过延长这个向量得到的直线

100
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,650
I end up with pretty small
最后我得到非常小的

101
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,400
reconstruction errors and reference
重建误差

102
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,220
data looks like this.
参考数据看上去是这样的

103
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,640
And by the way,
此外

104
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,310
I should mention that whether PCA
我应该指出的是，无论PCA

105
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,150
gives me U1 or negative U1, it doesn't matter.
给出的是这个U1，还是负的U1，都没关系

106
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,630
So if it gives me a positive
如果它给出的是正的向量

107
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,530
vector in this direction that's fine, if it gives me,
在这个方向上，这没问题

108
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,910
sort of the opposite vector facing
如果给出的是相反的向量

109
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,160
in the opposite direction, so that
在相反的方向上

110
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,150
would be -U1, draw that in
也就是-U1，用蓝色来画

111
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,400
blue instead, whether it gives me positive
无论给的是正的

112
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,310
U1 negative U1,
还是负的U1

113
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
it doesn't matter, because each of
都没关系，因为

114
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,030
these vectors defines the
每一个方向都定义了

115
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,660
same red line onto which
相同的红色直线

116
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,430
I'm projecting my data. So this
也就是我将投影的方向

117
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,300
is a case of reducing data
这就是将

118
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,120
from 2 dimensional to 1 dimensional.
2维数据降到1维的例子

119
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,220
In the more general case we
更一般的情况是

120
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,680
have N dimensional data and
我们有N维的数据

121
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,790
we want to reduce it K dimensions.
想降到K维

122
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,010
In that case, we want to
在这种情况下

123
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,450
find not just a single vector
我们不仅仅只寻找单个的向量

124
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,020
onto which to project the data
来对数据进行投影

125
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,660
but we want to find K dimensions
我们想寻找K个方向

126
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,420
onto which to project the data.
来对数据进行投影

127
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,680
So as to minimize this projection error.
为了最小化投影误差

128
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,100
So here's an example.
这是一个例子

129
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,100
If I have a 3D point
如果我有3维数据点

130
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,030
cloud like this then maybe
比如说像这样的

131
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,620
what I want to do is find
我想要做的是

132
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,120
vectors, sorry find a pair of vectors,
寻找向量，对不起，是寻找两个向量

133
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,180
and I'm gonna call these vectors
我将这些向量叫做...

134
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,530
lets draw these in red, I'm going
我们用红线画出来

135
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,210
to find a pair of vectors,
我要寻找两个向量

136
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,580
extending for the origin here's
从原点延伸出来

137
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,280
U1, and here's
这是U1

138
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,800
my second vector U2,
这是第二个向量U2

139
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,110
and together these two
这两个向量一起

140
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,850
vectors define a plane,
定义了一个平面

141
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,590
or they define a 2D surface,
或者说，定义了一个2维平面

142
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,900
kind of like this, sort of,
类似于这样的

143
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,140
2D surface, onto which I'm going to project my data.
2维平面，我将把数据投影到上面

144
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,900
For those of you that are
对于你们其中

145
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,980
familiar with linear algebra, for
熟悉线性代数的人来说

146
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,010
those of you that are really experts
对于你们其中真的

147
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,380
in linear algebra, the formal
精通线性代数的人来说，

148
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,820
definition of this is that
对这个正式的定义是

149
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,500
we're going to find a set of
我们将寻找一组向量

150
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,680
vectors, U1 U2 maybe up
U1，U2，也许

151
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,370
to Uk, and what
一直到Uk

152
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,490
we're going to do is project
我们将要做的是

153
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,600
the data onto the linear
将数据投影到

154
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,520
subspace spanned by this set of k vectors.
这k个向量张开的线性子空间上

155
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,570
But if you are not familiar
但是如果你不熟悉

156
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,200
with linear algebra, just think
线性代数，那就想成是

157
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,790
of it as finding k directions
寻找k个方向

158
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,380
instead of just one direction, onto which to project the data.
而不是只寻找一个方向，对数据进行投影

159
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,950
So, finding a k-dimensional surface,
所以，寻找一个k维的平面

160
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,560
really finding a 2D plane
在这里是寻找2维的平面

161
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,870
in this case, shown in this
如图所示

162
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,340
figure, where we can
这里我们用

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,700
define the position of the points in the plane using k directions.
k个方向来定义平面中这些点的位置

164
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,690
That's why for PCA, we
这就是为什么，对于PCA

165
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,440
want to find k vectors onto which to project the data.
我们要寻找k个向量来对数据进行投影

166
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,920
And so, more formally, in
因此，更正式一点的说

167
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,430
PCA what we want
在PCA中，我们想做的就是

168
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,400
to do is find this way
寻找到这种方式

169
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,940
to project the data so as
对数据进行投影

170
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,570
to minimize the, sort of,
进而最小化投影距离

171
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,210
projection distance, which is distance between points and projections.
也就是数据点和投影后的点之间的距离

172
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
In this so 3D example,
在这个3维的例子里

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,100
too, given a point we
给定一个点

174
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,450
would take the point and project
我们想将这个点

175
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,950
it onto this 2D surface.
投影到2维平面上

176
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,580
When you're done with that,
当你完成了那个

177
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,690
and so the projection error would
因此投影误差就是

178
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,830
be, you know, the distance between the
也就是

179
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,160
point and where it gets projected down.
这点与投影到

180
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,360
to my 2D surface,
2维平面之后的点之间的距离

181
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,990
and so what PCA does is it'll
因此PCA做的是

182
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,480
try to find a line or
寻找一条直线

183
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,430
plane or whatever onto which
或者平面，诸如此类等等

184
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,810
to project the data, to try
对数据进行投影

185
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,160
to minimize that squared projection,
来最小化平方投影

186
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,430
that 90 degree, or that orthogonal projection error.
90度的或者正交的投影误差

187
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,240
Finally, one question that I
最后

188
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,060
sometimes get asked is how
一个我有时会被问到的问题是

189
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,100
does PCA relate to
PCA和线性回归有怎么样的关系？

190
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,180
linear regression, because when explaining
因为当我解释PCA的时候

191
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,780
PCA I sometimes end up
我有时候会以

192
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,720
drawing diagrams like these and that looks a little bit like linear regression.
画这样的图表来结束，看上去有点像线性回归

193
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,130
It turns out PCA is not
但是，事实是

194
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,950
linear regression, and despite
PCA不是线性回国

195
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,560
some cosmetic similarity these are actually totally different algorithms.
尽管看上去有一些相似性，但是它们确实是两种不同的算法

196
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,680
If we were doing linear regression
如果我们做线性回国

197
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,170
what we would do would be, on
我们 做的是

198
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,940
the left we would be trying
看左边，我们想要

199
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,400
to predict the value of some
在给定某个输入特征x的情况下

200
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,830
variable y given some input
预测某个变量y的数值

201
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,330
features x. And so linear
因此，对于线性回归

202
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,760
regression, what we're doing
我们想做的是

203
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,350
is we're fitting a straight line
拟合一条直线

204
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,970
so as to minimize the squared
来最小化

205
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:56,160
error between a point and the straight line.
点和直线之间的平方误差

206
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,270
And so what we'd be minimizing
所以我们要最小化的是

207
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,320
would be the squared magnitude of these blue lines.
这些蓝线幅值的平方

208
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,240
And notice I'm drawing these
注意我画的这些

209
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,650
blue lines vertically, that they
蓝色的垂直线

210
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,500
are the vertical distance between
这是垂直距离

211
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,700
a point and the value
它是某个点

212
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,470
predicted by the hypothesis, whereas in
与通过假设的得到的其预测值之间的距离

213
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,100
contrast, in PCA, what it
与此想反

214
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,170
does is it tries to
PCA要做的是

215
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,890
minimize the magnitude of these blue lines,
最小化这些蓝色直线的幅值

216
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,550
which are drawn at an angle,

217
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,590
these are really the shortest orthogonal

the point X and this
点X

220
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,320
red line, and this

221
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,870
gives very different effects, depending
这是一种非常不同的效果

222
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,050
on the data set.
取决于数据集

223
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,610
And more generally generally and

224
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,890
more generally when you're doing

225
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,740
linear regression there is this
线性回归的时候，有一个

226
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,810
distinguished variable y that

we're trying to predict, all that

of X and try to use

in PCA, there is no

232
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,200
distinguished or there is

240
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,180
As one last example, if I
最后一个例子中

241
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,220
have three-dimensional data, and

254
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,210
linear regression, and even
不是线性回归

255
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,870
though at some cosmetic level they

256
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,260
might look related, these are

257
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,580
actually very different algorithms. So,

258
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,360
hopefully you now understand what
