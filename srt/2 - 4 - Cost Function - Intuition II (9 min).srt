00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,684
In this video, lets delve deeper and get
even better intuition about what the cost
在这段视频中 让我们更深刻的研究更直觉的体会代价函数是来干什么的
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:10,523
function is doing. This video assumes that
you're familiar with contour plots. If you
此视频以你熟悉等高线图的绘制为前提

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:15,189
are not familiar with contour plots or
contour figures some of the illustrations
如果你不熟悉等高线图 这个视频中的某些描述

4
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:20,144
in this video may or may not make sense to
you but is okay and if you end up skipping
对你来说明确或者不明确都没关系 如果你因为以前没有见过等高线

5
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:24,522
this video or some of it does not quite
make sense because you haven't seen
而跳过这个视频或跳过一部分视频也不会有多大的影响

6
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:29,246
contour plots before. That's okay and you will
still understand the rest of this course
如果没有这部分知识 你仍然能理解这门课程的其他内容

7
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:34,935
without those parts of this. Here's our
problem formulation as usual, with the
下面是我们的问题 和往常一样

8
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:39,882
hypothesis parameters, cost function, and
our optimization objective. Unlike
有假设参数 代价函数 和我们的优化目标

9
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:45,163
before, unlike the last video, I'm
going to keep both of my parameters, theta
不像上次的视频那样 在对代价函数以可视化时 我要保留我所有的参数 θ0 和 θ1

10
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:50,573
zero, and theta one, as we generate our
visualizations for the cost function. So, same
所以像上次一样的

11
00:00:50,573 --> 00:00:57,204
as last time, we want to understand the
hypothesis H and the cost function J. So,
我们想了解假设函数h和代价函数 J 因此

12
00:00:57,204 --> 00:01:04,167
here's my training set of housing prices
and let's make some hypothesis. You know,
这里是我的训练集的住房价格 让我们做一些假设

13
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:10,219
like that one, this is not a particularly
good hypothesis. But, if I set theta
像这一个 这是不是一个特别好的假设 但是当我设置 θ0=50

14
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:16,270
zero=50 and theta one=0.06, then I end up
with this hypothesis down here and that
和 θ1= 0.06 那么我就得到了对应这条直线的以下一假设

15
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,190
corresponds to that straight line. Now given
these value of theta zero and theta one,
既然 θ0 和 θ1 被如此赋值

16
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:27,511
we want to plot the corresponding, you
know, cost function on the right. What we
我们要在右边绘制相应的 你知道 代价函数

17
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:33,150
did last time was, right, when we only had
theta one. In other words, drawing plots
像上次做的那样 当时 我们只有θ1

18
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,814
that look like this as a function of theta
one. But now we have two parameters, theta
因为函数只有一个参数 θ1 画出来的图像这样 但现在我们有两个参数

19
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:42,340
zero, and theta one, and so the plot gets
a little more complicated. It turns out
θ0 和 θ1 使图变得更复杂一点 事实证明

20
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,699
that when we have only one parameter, that
the parts we drew had this sort of bow
当我们只有一个参数 我们画的这部分想一个弓型的函数

21
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:52,925
shaped function. Now, when we have two
parameters, it turns out the cost function
现在 当我们有两个参数 代价函数有一个同样的弓型

22
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:58,218
also has a similar sort of bow shape. And,
in fact, depending on your training set,
而且事实上这取决于你的训练集

23
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:03,511
you might get a cost function that maybe
looks something like this. So, this is a
你可能会得到一个看起来像这样的代价函数

24
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:09,404
3-D surface plot, where the axes
are labeled theta zero and theta one. So
这是一个3D曲面图 轴标为 θ0 和 θ1

25
00:02:09,404 --> 00:02:15,326
as you vary theta zero and theta one, the two
parameters, you get different values of the
所以 当你改变 θ0 θ1 这两个参数 你会得到不同的代价函数

26
00:02:15,326 --> 00:02:20,964
cost function J (theta zero, theta one)
and the height of this surface above a
J(θ0,θ1) 的值 从表面到关于θ0 θ1 特殊点的高度

27
00:02:20,964 --> 00:02:26,347
particular point of theta zero, theta one.
Right, that's, that's the vertical axis. The
对 这是 这是竖轴

28
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:31,200
height of the surface of the points
indicates the value of J of theta zero, J
从表面到关于 θ0 θ1 特殊点的高度 就是 J (θ0,θ1) 的值

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,471
of theta one. And you can see it sort of
has this bow like shape. Let me show you
你可以看到 它像是有这样的碗型形状

30
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:46,351
the same plot in 3D. So here's the same
figure in 3D, horizontal axis theta one and
让我们在 3D 中展示这个图形 这是 3D 中的同样的图形 横轴 θ1

31
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:52,122
vertical axis J(theta zero, theta one), and if I rotate
this plot around. You kinda of a
竖直轴 J (θ0,θ1) 如果我旋转这个图形 你会找到点感觉

32
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:57,608
get a sense, I hope, of this bowl
shaped surface as that's what the cost
这个碗状曲面 就是代价函数的样子

33
00:02:57,608 --> 00:03:03,592
function J looks like. Now for the purpose
of illustration in the rest of this video
为了在以下的视频中进行分析

34
00:03:03,592 --> 00:03:09,077
I'm not actually going to use these sort
of 3D surfaces to show you the cost
我实际上不会使用 3D 曲面来展示代价函数 J

35
00:03:09,077 --> 00:03:16,475
function J, instead I'm going to use
contour plots. Or what I also call contour
我要使用等高线图 或者称为等高图像

36
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:24,748
figures. I guess they mean the same thing.
To show you these surfaces. So here's an
这两个词意义相同 为了向你展示这些曲面 因此这里是等高线图的例子

37
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:31,135
example of a contour figure, shown on the
right, where the axis are theta zero and
显示在右侧 其中的轴线为 θ0和θ1

38
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:37,602
theta one. And what each of these ovals,
what each of these ellipsis shows is a set
和这些椭圆形 省略的展现了一系列

39
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:43,757
of points that takes on the same value for
J(theta zero, theta one). So
J(θ0,θ1) 值相等的点 所以

40
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:50,514
concretely, for example this, you'll take
that point and that point and that point.
具体地说 例如这个 这一点 这一点 这一点

41
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:55,583
All three of these points that I just
drew in magenta, they have the same value
我用红色标注的这三个点 它们具有相同的 J(θ0,θ1) 值

42
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:59,730
for J (theta zero, theta one). Okay.
Where, right, these, this is the theta
好 这些 这是它的θ0 θ1轴

43
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,774
zero, theta one axis but those three have
the same Value for J (theta zero, theta one)
但上述三个点具有相同的 J(θ0,θ1) 值

44
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:10,218
and if you haven't seen contour
plots much before think of, imagine if you
如果你没有见过的等高线图 想象一下

45
00:04:10,218 --> 00:04:14,992
will. A bow shaped function that's coming
out of my screen. So that the minimum, so
呈现在我屏幕上的碗型函数 使它的值最小的

46
00:04:14,992 --> 00:04:19,668
the bottom of the bow is this point right
there, right? This middle, the middle of
碗底的底部就是的这一点 对不对?

47
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:24,285
these concentric ellipses. And imagine a
bow shape that sort of grows out of my
这些同心椭圆的中心 想象一个碗的形状渐渐变成我屏幕上的样子

48
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:28,786
screen like this, so that each of these
ellipses, you know, has the same height
所以在我屏幕上的每一个椭圆的 你知道 都有有相同的高度

49
00:04:28,786 --> 00:04:33,345
above my screen. And the minimum with the
bow, right, is right down there. And so
碗型的最小值 恰好在这里

50
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:37,787
the contour figures is a, is way to,
is maybe a more convenient way to
所以等高线图 也许是一个更方便的方式来显示函数 J

51
00:04:37,787 --> 00:04:45,185
visualize my function J. [sound] So, let's
look at some examples. Over here, I have a
所以让我们来看看一些例子 在这里 我有一个特殊点

52
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:53,275
particular point, right? And so this is,
with, you know, theta zero equals maybe
你知道 θ0可能等于800

53
00:04:53,275 --> 00:05:01,964
about 800, and theta one equals maybe a
-0.15 . And so this point, right, this
θ1可能等于-0.15 所以这点 对 红色的这点

54
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:07,322
point in red corresponds to one
set of pair values of theta zero, theta one
对应了一对θ0 θ1的值

55
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:12,092
and the corresponding, in fact, to that
hypothesis, right, theta zero is
事实上对于该假设而言 θ0约等于800

56
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:17,189
about 800, that is, where it intersects
the vertical axis is around 800, and this is
也就是说 它与垂直轴相交于800左右

57
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:21,763
slope of about -0.15. Now this line is
really not such a good fit to the
斜率约-0.15 现在 这条线是真的并没对数据进行一个很好的拟合

58
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:26,859
data, right. This hypothesis, h(x), with these values of theta zero,
对不对? 假设函数 h(x) 和θ0 θ1的值

59
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:32,283
theta one, it's really not such a good fit
to the data. And so you find that, it's
并没对数据进行一个很好的拟合 所以你会发现

60
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:37,531
cost. Is a value that's out here that's
you know pretty far from the minimum right
存在成本 是一个和最小值相比相当远的值

61
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:42,901
it's pretty far this is a pretty high cost
because this is just not that good a fit
这是一个相当高的成本 因为这并没有那么好地拟合数据

62
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:47,247
to the data. Let's look at some more
examples. Now here's a different
让我们来看看一些例子 现在 这里是一个不同的假设

63
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:52,489
hypothesis that's you know still not a
great fit for the data but may be slightly
同样并没有那么好地拟合数据 但可能会略好一点

64
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:57,986
better so here right that's my point that
those are my parameters theta zero theta
所以这里是我的点 这些是我的参数θ0 θ1的值 对吗

65
00:05:57,986 --> 00:06:07,387
one and so my theta zero value. Right?
That's bout 360 and my value for theta
θ0大概等于360 θ1=0

66
00:06:07,387 --> 00:06:14,047
one. Is equal to zero. So, you know, let's
break it out. Let's take theta zero equals
所以 你知道 让我们找出它 让我们把θ0=360

67
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:20,063
360 theta one equals zero. And this pair
of parameters corresponds to that
θ1=0 这对参数对应于这条假设函数

68
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:26,161
hypothesis, corresponds to flat line, that is, h(x) equals 360 plus zero
对应这条平行线 也就是 h(x)=360+0*x

69
00:06:26,161 --> 00:06:32,421
times x. So that's the hypothesis. And
this hypothesis again has some cost, and
所以这是假设函数 这个假设函数同样具有一定的成本

70
00:06:32,421 --> 00:06:38,600
that cost is, you know, plotted as the
height of the J function at that point.
要知道 这个成本即绘制在 J 函数在该点的高度

71
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:44,886
Let's look at just a couple of examples.
Here's one more, you know, at this value
让我们来看几个例子 这里还有一个 你知道 当给θ0这个值

72
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:52,231
of theta zero, and at that value of theta
one, we end up with this hypothesis, h(x)
给θ1那个值 我们最后又一次得到了假设函数 h(x)

73
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:58,599
and again, not a great fit to the data,
and is actually further away from the minimum. Last example, this is
不能非常拟合的数据 甚至离最小值有点远 最后一个例子

74
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:03,450
actually not quite at the minimum, but
it's pretty close to the minimum. So this
其实并不是最小值 但它是相当接近最小值的 因此

75
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:08,486
is not such a bad fit to the, to the data,
where, for a particular value, of, theta
并不是太坏的拟合该数据 其中 θ0 为一个特定的值

76
00:07:08,486 --> 00:07:13,337
zero. Which, one of them has value, as in
for a particular value for theta one. We
这里有一个特定的值给 θ1

77
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:18,004
get a particular h(x). And this is, this
is not quite at the minimum, but it's
于是我们得到了一个特殊的 h(x) 这并不是最小值

78
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:23,039
pretty close. And so the sum of squares
errors is sum of squares distances between
但是已经相当接近了 因此误差的平方的总和是训练样本与假设函数的距离的

79
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,259
my, training samples and my hypothesis.
Really, that's a sum of square distances,
的平方的和 这真的是一个距离的平方的总和 对不对?

80
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,548
right? Of all of these errors. This is
pretty close to the minimum even though
所有的这些误差 都相当接近最小值 虽然依旧不是最小值

81
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:37,096
it's not quite the minimum. So with these
figures I hope that gives you a better
因此通过这些图 我希望你更好地理解

82
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:41,869
understanding of what values of the cost
function J, how they are and how that
关于代价函数 J 他们是如何拟合不同的假设函数

83
00:07:41,869 --> 00:07:47,324
corresponds to different hypothesis and so as
how better hypotheses may corresponds to points
和当数据非常接近函数 J 的最小值

84
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:52,983
that are closer to the minimum of this cost
function J. Now of course what we really
假设函数到底能多好地拟合数据

85
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:57,619
want is an efficient algorithm, right, a
efficient piece of software for
我们真正想要的是一个高效的算法 一个高效的软件

86
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:02,218
automatically finding The value of theta
zero and theta one, that minimizes the
能自动找寻使 J 最小θ0 θ1

87
00:08:02,218 --> 00:08:06,566
cost function J, right? And what we, what
we don't wanna do is to, you know, how to
我们不想做的事情是 编写这样一个软件

88
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:10,697
write software, to plot out this point,
and then try to manually read off the
那就是绘制这个点 然后再尝试手动读取读数

89
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:15,263
numbers, that this is not a good way to do
it. And, in fact, we'll see it later, that
这并不容易做到 而且事实上 我们会在之后看到它

90
00:08:15,426 --> 00:08:19,938
when we look at more complicated examples,
we'll have high dimensional figures with
当我们看更复杂的例子 我们涉及到更多的参数 用到高维的图形

91
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:23,906
more parameters, that, it turns out,
we'll see in a few, we'll see later in
我们会在以后的课程中看到一些

92
00:08:23,906 --> 00:08:28,091
this course, examples where this figure,
you know, cannot really be plotted, and
不能被真正绘制的例子

93
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:33,664
this becomes much harder to visualize. And
so, what we want is to have software
视觉上更难表达 所以 我们需要有软件

94
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:37,729
to find the value of theta zero, theta one
that minimizes this function and
找到使函数最小的θ0 θ1的值

95
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:42,914
in the next video we start to talk about
an algorithm for automatically finding
在接下来的视频中 我们谈谈自动寻找使函数 J 最小的

96
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:47,600
that value of theta zero and theta one
that minimizes the cost function J.
