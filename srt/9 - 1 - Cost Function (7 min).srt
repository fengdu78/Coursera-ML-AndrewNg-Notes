00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,380
Neural Networks are one of
神经网络是当今
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,610
the most powerful learning algorithms that we have today.
最强大的学习算法之一

3
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,490
In this, and in the
在本节课视频

4
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,690
next few videos, I'd like to
和后面几次课程中

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,030
start talking about a learning
我将开始讲述一种

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,920
algorithm for fitting the parameters
在给定训练集下

7
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:12,530
of the neural network given the training set.
为神经网络拟合参数的学习算法

8
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,840
As for the discussion of most
正如我们讨论大多数

9
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,300
of the learning algorithms, we're going
学习算法一样

10
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,860
to begin by talking about the
我们准备从拟合神经网络参数的

11
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,510
cost function for fitting the parameters of the network.
代价函数开始讲起

12
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:22,650
I'm going to focus
我准备重点讲解

13
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,790
on the application of neural
神经网络在分类问题

14
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,590
networks to classification problems.
中的应用

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,860
So, suppose we have a
假设我们有一个如左边所示的

16
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,300
network like that shown on the left.
神经网络结构

17
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,510
And suppose we have a training
然后假设我们有一个

18
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,850
set like this of this of
像这样的训练集

19
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,550
Xi, Yi pairs of m training examples.
m个训练样本x(i) y(i)

20
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,040
I'm going to use upper case
我用大写字母 L

21
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,640
L to denote the
来表示

22
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,460
total number of layers in this network.
这个神经网络结构的总层数

23
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,550
So, for the network shown
所以 对于左边的网络结构

24
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:45,720
on the left, we would have
我们得到

25
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,920
capital L equals 4.
L等于4

26
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:48,910
And, I'm going to use
然后我准备用

27
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,740
s subscript L, to denote
sl表示

28
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,540
the number of units, that is
第L层的单元的数量

29
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,490
a number of neurons, not counting
也就是神经元的数量

30
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,180
the bias unit in layer L of the network.
这其中不包括L层的偏差单元

31
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,440
So, for example, we would
比如说

32
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,280
have a S1 which
我们得到s1 也就是输入层

33
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,330
is the input layer equals S3 unit,
是等于3的单元

34
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,970
S2 in my example is five units.
s2在这个例子里等于5个单位

35
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,670
And the output layer S4.
然后输出层s4

36
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,820
Which is also equals SL, because capital L is equal to four.
也就是sl 因为L本身等于4

37
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,290
The output layer in my
在左边这个例子中输出层

38
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,230
example in the left has four units.
有4个单位

39
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,880
We're going to consider two types of classification problems.
我们将会讨论两种分类问题

40
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,780
The first is binary classification,
第一种是二元分类

41
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,550
where the labels y are either zero or one.
在这里y只能等于0或1

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,540
In this case, we would have one output unit.
在这个例子中 我们有一个输出单元

43
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,260
So, this neural network on top
上面这个神经网络的有四个输出单元

44
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,430
has four output units, but if
但是如果我们

45
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,960
we had binary classification, we would
用二元分类的话

46
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,810
have only one output unit
我们就只能有一个输出结果

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,360
that computes h of x.
也就是计算出来的h(x)

48
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,550
And the outputs of the
神经网络的输出结果

49
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,960
neural network would be h
h(x)就会是

50
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,580
of x is going to be a real number.
一个实数

51
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,980
And in this case the number
在这类问题里

52
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,240
of output units, SL, where
输出单元的个数 sl

53
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,880
L is again the index
L同样代表最后一层的序号

54
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,970
of the final layer because that's
因为这就是我们

55
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,630
the number of layers we have in the network.
在这个网络结构中的层数

56
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,960
So the number of units we
所以我们在输出层的单元数目

57
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,060
have in the output layer is going to be equal to one.
就将是1

58
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,430
In this case, to simplify notation
在这类问题里 为了简化记法

59
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,340
later, I'm also going to set k equals 1.
我会把K设为1

60
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,560
So, you can think of k as
这样你可以把K看作

61
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,240
also denoting the number
输出层的

62
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,780
of units in the output layer.
单元数目

63
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,980
The second type of classification problem
我们要考虑的第二类分类问题

64
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,160
we'll consider will be multiclass classification
就是多类别的分类问题

65
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,020
problem where we may have k distinct classes.
也就是会有K个不同的类

66
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,760
So, our early example, I
比如说

67
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,530
had this representation for y
如果我们有四类的话

68
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,900
if we have four classes and
我们就用这样的表达形式来代表y

69
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,050
in this case, we would have caps lock K
在这类问题里 我们就会有K个输出单元

70
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,530
output units and our hypotheses
我们的假设输出

71
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,720
will output vectors that are K dimensional.
就是一个K维向量

72
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,230
And the number of output units
输出单元的个数

73
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,390
will be equal to K.
就等于K

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,020
And usually we will have
通常这类问题里

75
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,620
K greater than or equal
我们都有K大于

76
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,960
to three in this case, because
或等于3

77
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,340
if we had two classes then,
因为如果只有两个类别

78
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,560
you know, we don't need to
我们就不需要

79
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,330
use the one versus all method.
使用这种一对多的方法

80
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,640
We need to use the one versus
我们只有在K大于

81
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,950
all method only if we
或者等于3个类的时候

82
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,460
have K greater than or
才会使用这种

83
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,250
equal to three classes so we
一对多的方法

84
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,100
only have two classes we will
因为如果只有两个类别

85
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,670
need to use only one output unit.
我们就只需要一个输出单元就可以了

86
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,870
Now, let's define the cost function for our cost function for our neural network.
现在我们来为神经网络定义代价函数

87
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,130
The cost function we use for
我们在神经网络里

88
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,530
the neural network is going to
使用的代价函数

89
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,300
be a generalization of the
应该是逻辑回归里

90
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,340
one that we use for logistic
使用的代价函数的一般化形式

91
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,500
regression.  For logistic regression,
对于逻辑回归而言

92
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,440
we used to minimize the
我们通常使代价函数 J(θ)

93
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,490
cost function j of theta
最小化

94
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,550
that was minus 1 over
也就是-1/m

95
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,760
m of this cost function
乘以后面这个代价函数

96
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,570
and then plus this extra regularization
然后再加上这个额外正则化项

97
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,660
term here, where this was
这里是一个

98
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,020
a sum from j equals
j从1到n的求和形式

99
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,190
1 through n, because we
因为我们

100
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,760
did not regularize the bias term theta zero.
并没有把偏差项 0正则化

101
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,590
For a neural network our cost
对于一个神经网络来说

102
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,490
function is going to be a generalization of this.
我们的代价函数是这个式子的一般化形式

103
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,060
Where instead of having basically
这里不再是仅有一个

104
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,360
just one logistic regression output
逻辑回归输出单元

105
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,650
unit, we may instead have K of them.
取而代之的是K个

106
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,520
So here's our cost function.
所以这是我们的代价函数

107
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,300
Neural network now outputs vectors
神经网络现在输出了

108
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,920
in RK where K might
在K维的向量

109
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:48,830
be equal to 1 if we
这里K可以取到1 也就是

110
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,350
have the binary classification problem.
原来的二元分类问题

111
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,240
I'm going to use this notation,
我准备用这样一个记法

112
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,470
h of x subscript i, to denote the ith output.
h(x)带下标i 来表示第i个输出

113
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,860
That is h of x is a K dimensional vector.
也就是h(x)是一个K维向量

114
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,590
And so this subscript i just
下标 i 表示

115
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,400
selects out the ith element
选择了神经网络输出向量的

116
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,510
of the vector that is output by my neural network.
第i个元素

117
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,050
My cost function, j of
我的代价函数

118
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,580
theta is now going
J(θ) 将成为下面这样的形式

119
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,790
to be the following is minus one
-1/m乘以

120
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,850
over m of a sum
一个类似于我们在

121
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,780
of a similar term to what
逻辑回归里所用的

122
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,990
we have in logistic regression. Except that
求和项

123
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,360
we have this sum from K
除了这里我们求的是

124
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,490
equals one through K.  The
k从1到K的所有和

125
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,650
summation is basically a
这个求和项主要是

126
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,580
sum over my K output unit.
K个输出单元的求和

127
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,290
So, if I have four upper units.
所以如果我有四个输出单元

128
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,740
That is the final layer of my
也就是我的神经网络最后一层

129
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,530
neural network has four output
有四个输出单元

130
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,420
units then this sum
那么这个求和就是

131
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,680
from, this is a sum from
这个求和项就是

132
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,140
K equals one through four
求k等于从1到4的

133
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,550
of basically the logistic regression algorithms
每一个的逻辑回归算法的代价函数

134
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,640
cost function but summing
然后按四次输出的顺序

135
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,570
that cost function over each
依次把这些代价函数

136
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:47,120
of my four output units in turn.
加起来

137
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,970
And so, you notice
所以你会特别注意到

138
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,700
in particular that this applies
这个求和符号应用于

139
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,530
to YK, HK, because
yk和hk  因为

140
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,040
we're basically taking the K
我们主要是讨论

141
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,020
upper unit and comparing that
K个输出单元

142
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,590
to the value of YK, which
并且把它和yk的值相比

143
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,020
is you know, which is
yk的值就是

144
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,260
that one of those vectors
这些向量里表示

145
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,110
to say what cause it should be.
它应当属于哪个类别的量

146
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,060
And finally, the second term
最后 这里的第二项

147
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,490
here is the regularization
这就是类似于我们在逻辑回归里所用的

148
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,970
term similar to what we had for logistic regression.
正则化项

149
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,640
This summation terms looks really
这个求和项看起来

150
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,370
complicated and always doing
确实非常复杂

151
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,460
is a summing over these terms,
它所做的就是把这些项全部相加

152
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,670
theta j i l for
也就是对所有i j和l

153
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,340
all values of i j
的θji的值都相加

154
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,830
and l.  Except that we
正如我们在逻辑回归里一样

155
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,340
don't sum over the terms
这里要除去那些对应于偏差值的项

156
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,210
corresponding to these bias values
那些项我们是不加进去的

157
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,000
like we had for logistic progression.
那些项我们是不加进去的

158
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,080
Concretely, we don't sum
具体地说 我们不把

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,590
over the terms corresponding
那些对于i等于0的项

160
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,290
to where i is equal to zero.
加入其中

161
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,310
So, that is because
这是因为

162
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,010
when we are computing the activation
当我们计算神经元的激励值时

163
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,930
of the neuron, we have terms
我们会有这些项

164
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,630
like these, you know theta, i0
θi0

165
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,860
plus theta, i1,
加上θi1

166
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,410
x1 plus, and
乘以x1 再加上 等等等等

167
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,780
so on, where I guess
这里我认为

168
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,310
we could have a 2 there
我们可以加上2的上标

169
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,420
if this is the first hidden layer,
如果这是第一个隐含层的话

170
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,800
and so the values with
所以这些带0的项

171
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,730
the 0 there at that corresponds to
所以这些带0的项

172
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,110
something that multiplies into an
对应于乘进去了

173
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,460
x0 or an a0 and
x0 或者是a0什么的

174
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,950
so, this is kind of like
这就是一个类似于

175
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,810
a bias unit and by
偏差单元的项

176
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,020
analogy to what we were
类比于我们在做

177
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,680
doing for logistic progression, we won't
逻辑回归的时候

178
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,090
sum over those terms in
我们就不应该把这些项

179
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,050
our regularization term because we
加入到正规化项里去

180
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,470
don't want to regularize them and
因为我们并不想正规化这些项

181
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,140
string the values 0.
并把这些项设定为0

182
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,530
But this is just one possible convention
但这只是一个合理的规定

183
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,670
and even if you were
即使我们真的把他们加进去了

184
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,960
to sum over, you know, i equals 0 up
也就是i从0加到sL

185
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,810
to SL, it will work
这依然成立

186
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,720
about the same and it doesn't make a big difference.
并且不会有大的差异

187
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,760
But maybe this convention
但是这个"不把偏差项正规化"

188
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,790
of not regularizing the bias
的规定可能只是会

189
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,320
term is just slightly more common.
更常见一些

190
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,200
So, that's the cost function
好了 这就是我们准备

191
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,270
we're going to use to fill on your own network.
应用于神经网络的代价函数

192
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,130
In the next video, we'll start
在下一个视频中

193
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,270
to talk about an algorithm for
我会开始讲解一个算法

194
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,530
trying to optimize the cost function.
来最优化这个代价函数
