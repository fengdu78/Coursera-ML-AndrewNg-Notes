is spam or non-spam, for
能够用来区分垃圾邮件或非垃圾邮件

63
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,410
example, if a piece of
比如说 如果有封邮件

64
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,640
e-mail contains the word 'deal'

Andrew, maybe that means
包含了我的名字"Andrew"

73
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,870
the person actually knows who
这有可能是一个知道我的人写的

74
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,740
I am and that might mean it's
这说明这封邮件

75
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,090
less likely to be spam.
不太可能是垃圾邮件

76
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,580

the word "now" may be
"now(现在)"这个单词表明了

78
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,680
indicative of non-spam because
这封邮件可能并不是垃圾邮件

79
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,150
I get a lot of urgent

emails, and so on,
当然还有别的单词

81
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,220
and maybe we choose a hundred words or so.
我们可以选出这样成百上千的单词

82

Given a piece of email,
给出一封这样的邮件

83
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,930
we can then take this piece
我们可以将这封邮件

84
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,220
of email and encode
用一个特征向量

85
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,970
it into a feature
来表示

86
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,930
vector as follows.
方法如下

87
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,450
I'm going to take my list of a
现在我列出一些

88
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,560
hundred words and sort
之前选好的单词

89
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,620
them in alphabetical order say.
然后按字典序排序

90
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:57,980
It doesn't have to be sorted.
其实并不是一定要排序的啦

91
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,910
But, you know, here's a, here's
你看

92
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,080
my list of words, just count
这些是之前的单词 像“discount”

93
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,950
and so on, until eventually
等等

94
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,430
I'll get down to now, and so
还有单词"now" 等等

95
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,230
on and given a piece
看看这个例子

96
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:08,540
of e-mail like that shown on the
右边的这封邮件

97
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,640
right, I'm going to
我准备

98
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,400
check and see whether or
检查一下这些词汇

99
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,560
not each of these words
看它们是否

100
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,560
appears in the e-mail and then
出现在这封邮件中

101
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm going to define a feature
我用一个

102
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,130
vector x where in
特征向量x

103
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,260
this piece of an email on
表示右边的这封邮件

104
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,520
the right, my name doesn't
我的名字没有出现

105
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,210
appear so I'm gonna put a zero there.
因此这里是0

106
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,410
The word "by" does appear,
单词"buy(购买)"出现了

107
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,690
so I'm gonna put a one there
所以这里是1

108
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,450
and I'm just gonna put one's or zeroes.
注意在向量里面只有1或0 表示有没有出现

109
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,550
I'm gonna put a
所以尽管"buy"出现了两次

110
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,950
one even though the word "by" occurs twice.
这里仍然只是1

111
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,490
I'm not gonna recount how many times the word occurs.
注意我不会去统计每个词出现的次数

112
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,280
The word "due" appears, I put a one there.
单词"deal"也出现了 所以这里也是1

113
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,450
The word "discount" doesn't appear, at
单词"discount"并没有出现

114
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,680
least not in this this little
至少在这封邮件里是这样

115
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,140
short email, and so on.
以此类推

116
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,740
The word "now" does appear and so on.
单词"now"出现了

117
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,250
So I put ones and zeroes
所以我在特征向量中

118
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
in this feature vector depending on
依据对应的单词是否出现

119
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,230
whether or not a particular word appears.
填上0和1

120
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,740
And in this example my
在这个例子中

121
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,850
feature vector would have
因为我选择了100个单词

122
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,920
to mention one hundred,
用于表示是否可能为垃圾邮件

123
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,960
if I have a hundred,
所以

124
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,460
if if I chose a hundred
这个特征向量x

125
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,850
words to use for
的维度是100

126
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,980
this representation and each
并且

127
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,060
of my features Xj will
如果这个特定的单词

128
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,150
basically be 1 if
即单词 j 出现在

129
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,410
you have a particular word that,
这封邮件中

130
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,930
we'll call this word j, appears
那么每一个特征变量

131
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,940
in the email and Xj
Xj 的值为1

132
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,910
would be zero otherwise.
反之 Xj为0

133
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Okay.
好的

134
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,440
So that gives me
这样我们就可以使用特征向量

135
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,220
a feature representation of a piece of email.
来表示这封邮件

136
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,060
By the way, even though I've
顺便说一句

137
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,260
described this process as manually
虽然我所描述的这个过程是我自己

138
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,790
picking a hundred words, in
选取的100个单词

139
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,510
practice what's most commonly
但是在实际工作中 最普遍的做法是

140
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,140
done is to look through
遍历整个训练集

141
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,710
a training set, and in
然后

142
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,980
the training set depict the
在训练集中

143
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,690
most frequently occurring n words
选出出现次数最多的n个单词

144
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,290
where n is usually between ten
n一般介于10,000和50,000之间

145
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,310
thousand and fifty thousand, and use
然后把这些单词

146
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,810
those as your features.
作为你要用的特征

147
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,910
So rather than manually picking a
因此不同于手动选取

148
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,220
hundred words, here you look
我们只用遍历

149
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,030
through the training examples and
训练样本

150
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,570
pick the most frequently occurring words
然后选出出现频率最高的词语

151
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,860
like ten thousand to fifty thousand
差不多是10,000到50,000个单词

152
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,680
words, and those form the
这些单词会构成特征

153
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,550
features that you are going
这样你就可以用它们

154
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,320
to use to represent your email for spam classification.
来做垃圾邮件分类

155
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,850
Now, if you're building a
如果你正在构造一个垃圾邮件分类器

156
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,020
spam classifier one question
你应该会面对这样一个问题

157
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,260
that you may face is, what's
那就是

158
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,580
the best use of your time
如何在有限的时间和精力下

159
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,820
in order to make your
改进你的方法

160
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,510
spam classifier have higher accuracy, you have lower error.
从而使得你的垃圾邮件分类器具有较高的准确度

161
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,350
One natural inclination is going to collect lots of data.
从直觉上讲 是要收集大量的数据

162
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Right?
对吧？

163
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,120
And in fact there's this tendency
事实上确实好多人这么做

164
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,670
to think that, well the
很多人认为

165
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,590
more data we have the better the algorithm will do.
收集越多的数据 算法就会表现的越好

166
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,850
And in fact, in the email
事实上

167
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,500
spam domain, there are actually
就垃圾邮件分类而言

168
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,840
pretty serious projects called Honey
有一个叫做"Honey Pot"的项目

169
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,310
Pot Projects, which create fake
它可以建立一个

170
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,090
email addresses and try to
假的邮箱地址

171
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,910
get these fake email addresses into
故意将这些地址

172
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,710
the hands of spammers and use
泄露给发垃圾邮件的人

173
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,870
that to try to collect tons
这样就能收到大量的垃圾邮件

174
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,440
of spam email, and therefore
你看 这样的话

175
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
you know, get a lot of spam data to train learning algorithms.
我们就能得到非常多的垃圾邮件来训练学习算法

176
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,760
But we've already seen in the
但是

177
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,630
previous sets of videos
在前面的课程中我们知道

178
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,340
that getting lots of data will often help, but not all the time.
大量的数据可能会有帮助 也可能没有

179
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,810
But for most machine learning problems,
对于大部分的机器学习问题

180
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,280
there are a lot of other things
还有很多办法

181
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,780
you could usually imagine doing to improve performance.
用来提升机器学习的效果

182
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,130
For spam, one thing you
比如对于垃圾邮件而言

183
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,420
might think of is to develop
也许你会想到

184
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,620
more sophisticated features on the
用更复杂的特征变量

185
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,070
email, maybe based on the email routing information.
像是邮件的路径信息

186
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,920
And this would be information contained in the email header.
这种信息通常会出现在邮件的标题中

187
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,820
So, when spammers send email,
因此 垃圾邮件发送方在发送垃圾邮件时

188
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,420
very often they will try
他们总会试图

189
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,110
to obscure the origins of
让这个邮件的来源变得模糊一些

190
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,260
the email, and maybe
或者是

191
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,880
use fake email headers.
用假的邮件标题

192
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,060
Or send email through very
或者通过不常见的服务器

193
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,360
unusual sets of computer service.
来发送邮件

194
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,880
Through very unusual routes, in order to get the spam to you.
用不常见的路由 他们就能给你发送垃圾邮件

195
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,690
And some of this information will be reflected in the email header.
而且这些信息也有可能包含在邮件标题部分

196
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
And so one can imagine,
因此可以想到

197
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,300
looking at the email headers and
我们可以通过邮件的标题部分

198
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,060
trying to develop more sophisticated features
来构造更加复杂的特征

199
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,760
to capture this sort of

200
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,770
email routing information to identify if something is spam.
进而判定这是否是一封垃圾邮件

201
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,890
Something else you might consider doing
你还可能会想到别的方法

202
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,300
is to look at the
比如

203
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,860
email message body, that is
从邮件的正文出发

204
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,350
the email text, and try to develop more sophisticated features.
寻找一些复杂点的特征

205
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,310
For example, should the word
例如

206
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,560
'discount' and the word
单词"discount"

207
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,340
'discounts' be treated as
是否和单词"discounts"是一样的

208
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,810
the same words or should
又比如

209
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,120
we have treat the words 'deal' and 'dealer' as the same word?
单词"deal(交易)"和"dealer(交易商)"是否也应视为等同

210
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,610
Maybe even though one is
甚至 像这个例子中

211
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:08,020
lower case and one in capitalized in this example.
有的单词小写有的大写

212
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,530
Or do we want more complex features about punctuation because maybe spam
或者我们是否应该用标点符号来构造复杂的特征变量

213
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,110
is using exclamation marks a lot more.
因为垃圾邮件可能会更多的使用感叹号

214
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:14,730
I don't know.
这些都不一定

215
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,850
And along the same lines, maybe
同样的

216
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,560
we also want to develop more

217
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,380
sophisticated algorithms to detect
更加复杂的算法来检测

218
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,700
and maybe to correct to deliberate misspellings,
或者纠正那些故意的拼写错误

219
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,700
like mortgage, medicine, watches.
例如 "m0rtgage" "med1cine" "w4tches"

220
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,890
Because spammers actually do this,
因为垃圾邮件发送方确实这么做了

221
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,400
because if you have watches
因为如果你将4放到"w4tches"中

222
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,060
with a 4 in there then well,
那么

223
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,720
with the simple technique that we
用我们之前提到的

224
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,760
talked about just now, the spam
简单的方法

225
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,280
classifier might not equate
垃圾邮件分类器不会把"w4tches"

226
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,170
this as the same thing as the
和"watches"

227
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,260
word "watches," and so it
看成一样的

228
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,430
may have a harder time realizing
这样我们就很难区分这些

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,930
that something is spam with these deliberate misspellings.
故意拼错的垃圾邮件

230
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,940
And this is why spammers do it.
发垃圾邮件的也很机智 他们这么做就逃避了一些过滤

231
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,280
While working on a machine learning
当我们使用机器学习时

232
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,370
problem, very often you

233
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,690
can brainstorm lists of different things to try, like these.
想出一堆方法来试试 就像这样

234
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,560
By the way, I've actually

00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,480
worked on the spam
我有一段时间

236
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,000
problem myself for a while.

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,610
And I actually spent quite some time on it.
实际上我花了很多时间来研究这个

238
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,040
And even though I kind

hard time telling you of

happens far too often is

248
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,330
product group will randomly fixate on one of these options.

out not to be the most
