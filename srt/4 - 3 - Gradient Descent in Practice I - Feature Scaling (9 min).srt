00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,720
the video after this one, I
以及下一段视频中

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,040
wanna tell you about some of
我想告诉你一些关于

4
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,940
the practical tricks for making gradient descent work well.
梯度下降运算中的实用技巧

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,250
In this video, I want to tell you about an idea called feature skill.
在这段视频中 我会告诉你一个称为特征缩放 (feature scaling) 的方法

6
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,210
Here's the idea.
这个方法如下

7
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,080
If you have a problem where you
如果你有一个机器学习问题

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,880
have multiple features, if you
这个问题有多个特征

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,410
make sure that the features
如果你能确保这些特征

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,440
are on a similar scale, by
都处在一个相近的范围

11
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,480
which I mean make sure that
我的意思是确保

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,130
the different features take on
不同特征的取值

13
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,390
similar ranges of values,
在相近的范围内

14
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,490
then gradient descents can converge more quickly.
这样梯度下降法就能更快地收敛

15
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,680
Concretely let's say you
具体地说

16
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,860
have a problem with two features
假如你有一个具有两个特征的问题

17
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,680
where X1 is the size
其中 x1 是房屋面积大小

18
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,860
of house and takes on values
它的取值

19
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,540
between say zero to two thousand
在0到2000之间

20
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,270
and two is the number
x2 是卧室的数量

21
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,570
of bedrooms, and maybe that takes
可能这个值

22
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,250
on values between one and five.
取值范围在1到5之间

23
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,690
If you plot the contours of
如果你画出代价函数

24
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,000
the cos function J of theta,
J(θ) 的轮廓图

25
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,540
then the contours may look
那么这个轮廓看起来

26
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,010
like this, where, let's see,
应该是像这样的

27
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,570
J of theta is a function
J(θ) 是一个关于

28
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,590
of parameters theta zero, theta one and theta two.
参数 θ0 θ1 和 θ2 的函数

29
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,400
I'm going to ignore theta zero,
但我要忽略 θ0

30
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,230
so let's about theta 0
所以暂时不考虑 θ0

31
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,730
and pretend as a function of
并假想一个函数的变量

32
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,080
only theta 1 and theta
只有 θ1 和 θ2

33
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,810
2, but if x1 can take on
但如果 x1 的取值范围

34
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,110
them, you know, much larger range
远远大于 x2 的取值范围的话

35
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,790
of values and x2 It turns
那么最终画出来的

36
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,270
out that the contours of the
代价函数 J(θ) 的轮廓图

37
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,320
cause function J of theta
就会呈现出这样一种

38
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,400
can take on this very
非常偏斜

39
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,720
very skewed elliptical shape, except
并且椭圆的形状

40
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,620
that with the so 2000 to
2000 和 5的比例

41
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,470
5 ratio, it can be even more secure.
会让这个椭圆更加瘦长

42
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,190
So, this is very, very tall
所以 这是一个又瘦又高的

43
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,070
and skinny ellipses, or these
椭圆形轮廓图

44
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,950
very tall skinny ovals, can form
就是这些非常高大细长的椭圆形

45
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,940
the contours of the cause function J of theta.
构成了代价函数 J(θ)

46
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,860
And if you run gradient descents
而如果你用这个代价函数

47
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,290
on this cos-function, your
来运行梯度下降的话

48
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,480
gradients may end up
你要得到梯度值 最终可能

49
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,660
taking a long time and
需要花很长一段时间

50
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,360
can oscillate back and forth
并且可能会来回波动

51
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,130
and take a long time before it
然后会经过很长时间

52
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,120
can finally find its way to the global minimum.
最终才收敛到全局最小值

53
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,720
In fact, you can imagine if these
事实上 你可以想像 如果这些

54
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,400
contours are exaggerated even
轮廓再被放大一些的话

55
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,970
more when you draw incredibly
如果你画的再夸张一些

56
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,300
skinny, tall skinny contours,
把它画的更细更长

57
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,030
and it can be even more extreme
那么可能情况会更糟糕

58
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,060
than, then, gradient descent
梯度下降的过程

59
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,310
just have a much
可能更加缓慢

60
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,280
harder time taking it's way,
需要花更长的时间

61
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,030
meandering around, it can take
反复来回振荡

62
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,270
a long time to find this way to the global minimum.
最终才找到一条正确通往全局最小值的路

63
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:14,370
In these settings, a useful
在这样的情况下

64
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,280
thing to do is to scale the features.
一种有效的方法是进行特征缩放(feature scaling)

65
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,760
Concretely if you instead
具体来说

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,370
define the feature X
把特征 x 定义为

67
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,770
one to be the size of
房子的面积大小

68
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,070
the house divided by two thousand,
除以2000的话

69
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,140
and define X two to be
并且把 x2 定义为

70
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,520
maybe the number of bedrooms divided
卧室的数量除以5

71
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,010
by five, then the
那么这样的话

72
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,020
count well as of the
表示代价函数 J(θ)

73
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,840
cost function J can become
的轮廓图的形状

74
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,430
much more, much less
就会变得偏移没那么严重

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,990
skewed so the contours may look more like circles.
可能看起来更圆一些了

76
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,180
And if you run gradient
如果你用这样的代价函数

77
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,540
descent on a cost function like
来执行梯度下降的话

78
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,120
this, then gradient descent,
那么 梯度下降算法

79
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,630
you can show mathematically, you can
你可以从数学上来证明

80
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,430
find a much more direct path
梯度下降算法 就会找到一条

81
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,830
to the global minimum rather than taking
更捷径的路径通向全局最小

82
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,200
a much more convoluted path
而不是像刚才那样

83
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,530
where you're sort of trying to
 沿着一条让人摸不着头脑的路径

84
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,520
follow a much more complicated
一条复杂得多的轨迹

85
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,910
trajectory to get to the global minimum.
来找到全局最小值

86
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,710
So, by scaling the features so
因此 通过特征缩放

87
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,000
that there are, the consumer ranges of values.
通过"消耗掉"这些值的范围

88
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,810
In this example, we end up
在这个例子中

89
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,150
with both features, X one
我们最终得到的两个特征

90
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,960
and X two, between zero and one.
x1 和 x2 都在0和1之间

91
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:12,290
You can wind up with an implementation of gradient descent.
这样你得到的梯度下降算法

92
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,810
They can convert much faster.
就会更快地收敛

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,640
More generally, when we're performing
更一般地

94
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,240
feature scaling, what we often
我们执行特征缩放时 也就是我们经常

95
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,480
want to do is get every
我们通常的目的是

96
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,670
feature into approximately a  -1
将特征的取值约束到

97
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,170
to +1 range and concretely,
-1 到 +1 的范围内

98
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,710
your feature x0 is always equal to 1.
你的特征 x0 是总是等于1

99
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,810
So, that's already in that range,
因此 这已经是在这个范围内

100
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,150
but you may end up dividing
但对其他的特征

101
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,950
other features by different numbers
你可能需要通过除以不同的数

102
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,150
to get them to this range.
来让它们处于同一范围内

103
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,520
The numbers -1 and +1 aren't too important.
-1 和 +1 这两个数字并不是太重要

104
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,900
So, if you have a feature,
所以 如果你有一个特征

105
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,340
x1 that winds up
x1 它的取值

106
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,000
being between zero and three, that's not a problem.
在0和3之间 这没问题

107
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,410
If you end up having a different
如果你有另外一个特征

108
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,190
feature that winds being
取值在-2 到 +0.5之间

109
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,020
between -2 and  + 0.5,
这也没什么关系

110
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,710
again, this is close enough
这也非常接近

111
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,070
to minus one and plus one
-1 到 +1的范围

112
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,160
that, you know, that's fine, and that's fine.
这些都可以

113
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,260
It's only if you have a
但如果你有另一个特征

114
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,580
different feature, say X 3
比如叫  x3

115
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,780
that is between, that
假如它的范围

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,070
ranges from -100 tp +100
在 -100 到 +100之间

117
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,850
, then, this is a
那么 这个范围

118
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,570
very different values than minus 1 and plus 1.
跟-1到+1就有很大不同了

119
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,020
So, this might be a
所以 这可能是一个

120
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,480
less well-skilled feature and similarly,
不那么好的特征

121
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,340
if your features take on a
类似地 如果你的特征在一个

122
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,680
very, very small range of
非常非常小的范围内

123
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,060
values so if X 4
比如另外一个特征

124
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,530
takes on values between minus
x4 它的范围在

125
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,290
0.0001 and positive 0.0001, then
0.0001和+0.0001之间 那么

126
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,780
again this takes on a
这同样是一个

127
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,960
much smaller range of values
比-1到+1小得多的范围

128
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,760
than the minus one to plus one range.
比-1到+1小得多的范围

129
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,630
And again I would consider this feature poorly scaled.
因此 我同样会认为这个特征也不太好

130
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:39,150
So you want the range of
所以 可能你认可的范围

131
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,350
values, you know, can be
也许可以大于

132
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,010
bigger than plus or smaller
或者小于 -1 到 +1

133
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,840
than plus one, but just
但是也别太大

134
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,170
not much bigger, like plus
只要大得不多就可以接受

135
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,470
100 here, or too
比如 +100

136
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,990
much smaller like 0.00 one over there.
或者也别太小 比如这里的0.001

137
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,530
Different people have different rules of thumb.
不同的人有不同的经验

138
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,910
But the one that I use is
但是我一般是这么考虑的

139
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,440
that if a feature takes
如果一个特征是在

140
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,750
on the range of values from
-3 到 +3 的范围内

141
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,590
say minus three the plus
那么你应该认为

142
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,120
3 how you should think that should
这个范围是可以接受的

143
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,690
be just fine, but maybe
但如果这个范围

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,050
it takes on much larger values
大于了 -3 到 +3 的范围

145
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,360
than plus 3 or minus 3
我可能就要开始注意了

146
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,400
unless not to worry and if
如果它的取值

147
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,660
it takes on values from say minus one-third to one-third.
在-1/3 到+1/3的话

148
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,020
You know, I think that's fine
我觉得 还不错 可以接受

149
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,880
too or 0 to one-third or minus one-third to 0.
或者是0到1/3 或-1/3到0

150
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,890
I guess that's typical range of value sector 0 okay.
这些典型的范围 我都认为是可以接受的

151
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,310
But it will take on a
但如果特征的范围

152
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,640
much tinier range of values
取得很小的话

153
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,220
like x4 here than gain on mine not to worry.
比如像这里的 x4 你就要开始考虑进行特征缩放了

154
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,060
So, the take-home message
因此 总的来说

155
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,780
is don't worry if your
不用过于担心

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,550
features are not exactly on

to be the standard deviation of the variable would be fine, too.

into these sorts of

228
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,820
ranges, and by the
但大概是这样的范围

229
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,700
way, for those of you that

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,380
are approximate and any value
都是非常近似的

238
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,010
that gets the features into

anything close to these sorts of ranges will do fine.
相近似的范围 就都是可以的

240
