2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,680
to work in through our example
我想通过例子来向大家展示

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,480
to show how a neural
一个神经网络

4
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:07,140
network can compute complex nonlinear hypotheses.
是怎样计算非线性的假设函数

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,240
In the last video, we saw
在上一段视频中

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,790
how a neural network can
我们学习了

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,900
be used to compute the functions
怎样运用神经网络

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,120
x1 and x2 and the
来计算x1和x2的与运算

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,410
function x1 or x2 when
以及x1和x2的或运算

10
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,250
x1 and x2 are binary.
其中x1和x2都是二进制数

11
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,080
That is, when they take on values of 0, 1.
也就是说 它们的值只能为0或1

12
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,580
We can also have a
同时 我们也学习了

13
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,130
network to compute negation, that
怎样进行逻辑非运算

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,040
is to compute the function  "not x1".
也就是计算 "非x1"

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,670
Let me just write
我先写出这个神经网络中

16
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,670
down the ways associated with this network.
相连接的各权值

17
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,350
We have only one input feature, x1
这里我们只有一个输入量x1

18
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,550
in this case and the
在这里我们也加上了

19
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,210
bias unit plus 1 and
表示偏差的单位元 +1

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,130
if I associate this with
如果我将输入单元和两个权数相连

21
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,610
the weights +10 and
也就是+10和-20

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,700
-20 then my hypotheses is computing this.
则可用以下假设方程来计算

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,740
H of x equals sigmoid of
h(x)=g(10-20x1)

24
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,600
10 minus 20 times x1
其中g是一个S型函数

25
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,710
so when x1 is
那么

26
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,880
equal to 0, my
当x1等于0时

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,060
hypothesis will be computing
计算出假设函数

28
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,340
g of 10 minus
g(10-20*0)

29
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,910
20 times 0 which is just 10.
也就是g(10)

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,600
And so that's approximately
这个值近似的等于1

31
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,390
1, and when is x is
而当x等于1时

32
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,300
equal to 1 this will
计算出的假设函数则变成

33
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,740
be g of  -10, which
g(-10)

34
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,380
is therefore approximately equal to 0.
也就是约等于0

35
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,320
And if you look at what
如果你观察这两个值

36
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,720
these values are, that's essentially
你会发现这实际上计算的

37
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,470
the "not x1" function.
就是“非x1”函数

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,410
So to include negations, the
所以要计算逻辑非运算

39
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,640
general idea is to put
总体思路是

40
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,460
a large negative weight in front
在你希望取非运算的变量前面

41
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,870
of the variable you want to negate.
放上一个绝对值大的负数作为权值

42
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,710
So if it's -20, multiplied by
因此 如果放一个-20

43
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,780
x1 and, you know, that's the general
那么和x1相乘

44
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,110
idea of how you end
很显然 最终的结果

45
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,500
up negating x1.
就得到了对x1进行非运算的效果

46
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,210
And so, in an example that
另外 我再给出一个例子

47
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,410
I hope you will figure out
计算这样一个函数

48
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,090
yourself, if you want
(非x1)与(非x2)

49
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,410
to compute a function like this:
我希望大家思考一下

50
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,870
"not x1 and not x2"
自己动手算一算

51
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,100
you know, while part of that would
你大概应该知道

52
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,860
probably be putting large negative
至少应该在x1和x2前面

53
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,150
weights in front of x1
放一个绝对值比较大的负数作为权值

54
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,330
and x2, but it should
不过

55
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,320
be feasible to get a
还有一种可行的方法

56
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,910
neural network with just
是建立一个神经网络来计算

57
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,810
one output unit to compute this as well.
用只有一个输出单元的神经网络

58
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,460
All right?
没问题吧？

59
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,130
So, this large fill
因此

60
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,290
function "not x1 and not
这个看起来很长的逻辑函数

61
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,990
x2" is going to
“(非x1)与(非x2)”的值

62
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,450
be equal to 1
将等于1

63
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,960
if, and only if, x1
当且仅当

64
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,860
equals x2 equals zero, right?
x1等于x2等于0

65
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,480
So this is a logical function, this
所以 这是个逻辑函数

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,290
is not x1, that means x1 must be zero and not x2.
这里是非x1 也就是说x1必为0

67
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,130
That means x2 must be equal to zero as well.
然后是非x2 这表示x2也必为0

68
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,210
So this logical function is
因此这个逻辑函数等于1

69
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,210
equal to 1 if, and only
当且仅当

70
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,900
if, both x1 and x2 are equal to zero.
x1和x2的值都为0时成立

71
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,600
And hopefully, you should be
现在你应该也清楚了

72
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,630
able to figure out how to make a
怎样建立一个小规模的神经网络

73
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,240
small neural network to compute
来计算

74
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,830
this logical function as well.
这个逻辑函数的值

75
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,350
Now, taking the three pieces
把以上我们介绍的

76
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,720
that we have put together, the
这三个部分内容放在一起

77
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,710
network for computing x1 and
"x1与x2"与运算的网络

78
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,620
x2 and the network for
以及计算

79
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,070
computing not x1 and
"(非x1)与(非x2)"的网络

80
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,170
not x2 and one last
还有最后一个是

81
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,910
network for computing x1 or
"x1或x2"的或运算网络

82
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,700
x2, we should be
把这三个网络放在一起

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,420
able to put these three pieces together
我们就应该能计算

84
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,270
to compute this x1, XNOR
"x1 XNOR x2"

85
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,810
x2 function.
也就是同或门运算

86
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,930
And just to remind you, if
提醒一下

87
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,130
this was x1, x2, this
如果这是x1 x2

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,830
function that we want to
那么我们想要计算的这个函数

89
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,900
compute would have negative examples
在这里和这里是负样本

90
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,690
here and here and we'd
而在这里和这里

91
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,370
have positive examples there and there.
函数有正样本值

92
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,270
And so clearly this, you know, we'll
那么很显然

93
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,400
need a nonlinear decision boundary
为了分隔开正样本和负样本

94
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,540
in order to separate the positive and negative examples.
我们需要一个非线性的判别边界

95
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,460
Let's draw the network.
这里我们用以下这个网络来解决

96
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm going to take my input
取输入单元

97
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,610
plus 1, x1, x2, and create
+1 x1和x2

98
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,390
my first hidden unit here.
建立第一个隐藏层单元

99
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,010
I'm going to call this a(2)1
我们称其为a(2)1

100
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,060
because that's my first hidden unit.
因为它是第一个隐藏单元

101
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,660
And I'm going to copy
接下来我要从红色的网络

102
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,410
the weights over from the Red
也就是"x1与x2"这个网络

103
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,020
Network, x1 and x2 networks.
复制出权值

104
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,410
So now minus 30, 20, 20.
也就是-30 20 20

105
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,060
Next, let me create
接下来

106
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,700
a second hidden unit, which
我再建立第二个隐藏单元

107
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm going to call a(2)2 that
我们称之为a(2)2

108
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,610
is the second hidden unit of layer two.
它是第二层的第二个隐藏单元

109
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,590
And I'm going to copy over the
然后再从中间的青色网络中

110
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,940
Cyan Network in the
复制出权值

111
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,080
middle, so I'm going
这样我们就有了

112
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,230
to have the weights 10, minus 20,
10 -20 -20

113
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,060
minus 20.
这样三个权值

114
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,570
And so, let's pull some of the truth table values.
因此 我们来看一下真值表中的值

115
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,350
For the Red Network, we know
对于红色的这个网络

116
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,340
that was computing the x1 and x2.
我们知道是x1和x2的与运算

117
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:00,940
And so this is
所以

118
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,460
going to be approximately 0, 0,
这里的值大概等于0 0 0 1

119
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,030
0, 1, depending on the values of x1 and x2.
这取决于x1和x2的具体取值

120
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,560
And for a (2)2, that's the Cyan Network.
对于a (2)2 也就是青色的网络

121
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,750
Well that we know the function not x1
我们知道这是“(非x1)与(非x2)”的运算

122
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,640
and not x2 then outputs 1,
那么对于x1和x2的四种取值

123
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,610
0, 0, 0 for the
其结果将为

124
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,830
4 values of x1 and x2.
1 0 0 0

125
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,560
Finally, I'm going to
最后

126
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,300
create my output note, my
建立输出节点

127
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,950
output unit that is a(3)1.
也就是输出单元 a(3)1

128
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,230
This is one more output h
这也是等于输出值h(x)

129
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,270
of x and I'm
然后

130
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,030
going to copy over the OR
复制一个或运算网络

131
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,470
Network for that and I'm going to
同时

132
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,330
need a plus one bias unit here.
我需要一个+1作为偏差单元

133
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,010
So, draw that in and I'm
将其添加进来

134
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,360
going to copy over the weights from the Green Networks.
然后从绿色的网络中复制出所有的权值

135
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,750
So, it's minus 10, 20, 20
也就是-10 20 20

136
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,460
and we know earlier that this computes the OR function.
我们之前已经知道这是一个或运算函数

137
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,200
So, let's go on the truth table entries.
那么我们继续看真值表的值

138
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,660
For the first entry is 0
第一行的值是0和1的或运算

139
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,930
or 1, which is gonna be
其结果为1

140
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,710
1 then next 0 or
然后是0和0的或运算

141
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,280
0, which is 0,
其结果为0

142
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,920
0, or 0, which is 0,
0和0的或运算 结果还是0

143
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,420
1 or 0 and that all
1和0的或运算

144
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,450
is to 1 and thus, h
其结果为1

145
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,820
of x is equal to 1
因此 h(x)的值等于1

146
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,270
when either both x1 and
当x1和x2都为0

147
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,360
x2 are 0 or when x1 and
或者x1和x2都为1的时候成立

148
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,160
x2 are both 1. And
具体来说

149
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,170
concretely, h of x
在这两种情况时

150
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,340
outputs 1 exactly at these
h(x)输出1

151
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,850
two locations and it outputs
在另两种情况时

152
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,270
0 otherwise and thus,
h(x)输出0

153
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:20,970
with this neural network, which
那么对于这样一个神经网络

154
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,030
has an input layer, one
