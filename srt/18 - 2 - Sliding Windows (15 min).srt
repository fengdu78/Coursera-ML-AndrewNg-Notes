00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,590
In the previous video, we talked
在上一个视频中，我们讨论了（字幕翻译：中国海洋大学，王玺）

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,570
about the photo OCR pipeline and how that worked.
OCR管道及其工作原理

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,370
In which we would take an image
在OCR管道中我们可以取一张图

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,070
and pass the image  Through a
（pass the image，不懂）通过

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,010
sequence of machine learning
一系列的机器学习

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,680
components in order to
组件来

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,820
try to read the text that appears in an image.
尝试读取图片上的文字

8
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,820
In this video I like to tell
今天的视频里，我打算讲

9
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,360
A little bit more about how the
多一点关于流水线

10
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,310
individual components of the pipeline works.
的每个组件的工作原理

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,070
In particular most of this video will center around the discussion.
特别的，本视频将会把重点放在讨论

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,950
of whats called a sliding windows.
滑动窗口上

13
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,570
The first stage
滤波的

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,390
of the filter was the
第一步是

15
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,090
Text detection where we look
确定文字位置，例如我们现在

16
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,640
at an image like this and try
看到的这一幅图片，尝试去

17
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,320
to find the regions of text that appear in this image.
找到图片中文字出现的区域

18
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,490
Text detection is an unusual problem in computer vision.
文字识别对于计算机来说，是一个不寻常的问题

19
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,820
Because depending on the length
因为根据你要尝试

20
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,150
of the text you're trying to
找到的文字的长度

21
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,870
find, these rectangles that you're
这些你要寻找的矩形

22
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,600
trying to find can have different aspect ratios
具有不同的长宽比例

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,060
So in order to talk
所以为了讲述如何

24
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,550
about detecting things in images
在图片中发现事物

25
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,860
let's start with a simpler example
我们首先从一个简单点的例子开始

26
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,080
of pedestrian detection and we'll then later go back to apply
即行人检测，然后我们讲如何将

27
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,300
Ideas that were developed
行人检测中的思路用到

28
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,840
in pedestrian detection and apply them to text detection.
文字识别中去

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,010
So in pedestrian detection you want
在行人检测中

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,440
to take an image that looks
你取一张类似这样的图片

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,010
like this and find the
目的就是寻找

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,920
individual pedestrians that appear in the image.
图片中的行人

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,440
So there's one pedestrian that we
我们找到一个人，

34
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,550
found, there's a second
两个，

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,920
one, a third one a fourth one, a fifth one.
三个，四个，五个

36
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,390
And a sixth one.
六个

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,990
This problem is maybe slightly
这个问题与文字识别相比，

38
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,770
simpler than text detection just
简单的地方在于：

39
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,200
for the reason that the aspect
你要识别的东西

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,490
ratio of most pedestrians are pretty similar.
具有相似的长宽比

41
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,280
Just using a fixed aspect
仅仅使用一个固定

42
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,960
ratio for these rectangles that we're trying to find.
的长宽比就基本可以了

43
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,610
So by aspect ratio I mean
aspect ratio意思是

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,420
the ratio between the height and the width of these rectangles.
矩形的高度和宽度之比

45
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:38,190
They're all the same.
它们都是一样的

46
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,120
for different pedestrians but for
对于不同的行人来说，但是

47
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,650
text detection the height
对于文字来说

48
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,560
and width ratio is different
不同行的文字

49
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,830
for different lines of text
具有不同的比例

50
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,940
Although for pedestrian detection, the
对于行人检测，尽管行人距离

51
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,250
pedestrians can be different distances
摄像头的距离可能

52
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,250
away from the camera and
不同，因此

53
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,730
so the height of these rectangles
矩形的高度

54
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,600
can be different depending on how far away they are.
不一致

55
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,090
but the aspect ratio is the same.
但比例还是维持不变的

56
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,880
In order to build a pedestrian
为了建立一个行人检测系统

57
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,460
detection system here's how you can go about it.
你需要这么做

58
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,650
Let's say that we decide to
例如我们决定要

59
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,100
standardize on this aspect
使用82*36的比例

60
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,010
ratio of 82 by 36
来进行标准化

61
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,040
and we could
当然我们也可以

62
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,510
have chosen some rounded number
选择一些近似的数字

63
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,000
like 80 by 40 or something, but 82 by 36 seems alright.
比如80*40，但82*36看上去是可行的

64
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,280
What we would do is then go
我们将要做的是

65
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,420
out and collect large training sets of positive and negative examples.
出去搜集一些正例和反例

66

73
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,790

pedestrian in that image patch,
是否有行人

105
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,100
and hopefully our classifier will
期望我们的分类器返回

106
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,600
return y equals 0 for that patch, since there is no pedestrian.
0或者1，对应是否有行人

107
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,900
Next, we then take that green
接下来，我们将

绿色矩形

109
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,680
over a bit and then
滑动一点

110
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,180
run that new image patch
然后通过

111
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,700
through our classifier to decide if there's a pedestrian there.

124
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,020
or stride of 1, that usually
为1，通常

125
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,560
