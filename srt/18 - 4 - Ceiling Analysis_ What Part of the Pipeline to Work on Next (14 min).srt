152
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,830
were going to keep going, next lets

153
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,120
go to the next selection of
接着执行流水线中的下一模块 字符分割

154
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,230
pipeline, two character segmentation and again were going to go to my test.
同前面一样 我还是去找出我的测试集

155
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,300

character segmentation outputs and
字符分割结果

159
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,780
manually label the correct

160
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,710
segment orientations of text into individual characters.
人工地给出正确的字符分割结果

161
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,560

然后看看这样做以后 效果怎样变化

162
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,670
And let's say it goes up to
假如我们这样做以后

163
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,140
90% accuracy for the overall system.
整个系统准确率提高到90%

164
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,060
Alright so as always the accuracy is.
注意跟前面一样 这里说的准确率

165
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,420
Accuracy of the overall systems.
是指整个系统的准确率

166
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,460
So whatever the final output
所以无论最后一个模块

167
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,450
of the character recognition system is.
字符识别模块给出的最终输出是什么

168
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,870
Whatever the final output of
无论整个流水线的

169
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,660
the overall pipeline is, it's going
最后输出结果是什么

170
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,400
to measure the accuracy of that.
我们都是测出的整个系统的准确率

171
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,720
And then finally like character recognition
最后我们还是执行最后一个模块 字符识别

172
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,170
system and give that the correct label as well.
同样也是人工给出这一模块的正确标签

173
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:29,270
And if I do that too then, no surprise that I should get a 100% accuracy.
这样做以后 我应该理所当然得到100%准确率

174
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,530
Now, the nice thing about having
进行上限分析的

175
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,340
done this analysis analysis is we
一个好处是

176
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,080
can now understand what is
我们现在就知道了

177
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,250
the upside potential for improving each of these components.
如果对每一个模块进行改善 它们各自的上升空间是多大

178
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,180
So we see that if we get perfect text detection.
所以 我们可以看到 如果我们拥有完美的文字检测模块

179
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,360
Our performance went up from
那么整个系统的表现将会从

180
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,080
72 to 89 percent, so
准确率72%上升到89%

181
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,670
that's' a 17 percent performance gain.
因此效果的增益是17%

182
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,680
So this means that you've
这就意味着

183
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,030
to take your current system you
如果你在现有系统的基础上

184
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,130
spend a lot of time improving text detection.
花费时间和精力改善文字检测模块的效果

185
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,750
That means that we could potentially improve
那么系统的表现

186
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,640
our system's performance by 17 percent.
可能会提高17%

187
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,850
This seems like it's well worth our while.
看起来这还挺值得

188
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,840
Whereas in contrast, when going
而相对来讲

189
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,360
from text detection When we
如果我们取得完美的字符分割模块

190
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,450
gave it perfect character segmentation, performance went up only by one percent.
那么最终系统表现只提升了1%

191
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,820
So, that's a more sobering message.
这便提供了一个很重要的信息

192
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,880
It means that no matter how
这就告诉我们

193
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,510
much time you spend character segmentation,
不管我们投入多大精力在字符分割上

194
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,990
maybe the upside potential is
系统效果的潜在上升空间

195
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
going to be pretty small, and maybe
也都是很小很小

196
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,420
you do not want to
所以你就不会让一个

197
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,340
have a large team of engineers
比较大的工程师团队

198
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,860
working on character segmentation that
花时间忙于字符分割模块

199
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,860
this sort of analysis shows that
因为通过上限分析我们知道了

200
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,180
even when you give it the
即使你把字符分割模块做得再好

201
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,480
perfect character segmentation, your
再怎么完美 你的系统表现

202
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,180
performance goes up by only one percent.
最多也只能提升1%

203
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,090
So right there, this is really estimates.
所以这就估计出

204
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,080
What is the ceiling, or what's
通过改善各个模块的质量

205
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,360
an upper bound on how much
你的系统表现

206
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:40,690
you can improve the performance of your
所能提升的上限值

207
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,710
system by working on one of these components?
或者说最大值 是多少

208
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,600
And finally, going for character,
最后

209
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,700
when we get better
如果我们取得完美的字符识别模块

210
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,080
character recognition, the performance went up by ten percent.
那么整个系统的表现将提高10%

211
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,640
So you know, again you
所以 同样

212
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,570
can decide, is a ten
你也可以分析

213
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,630
percent improvement, how much is that working out?
10%的效果提升值得投入多少工作量

214
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,200
It tells you that maybe
也许这也告诉你

215
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,670
with more efforts spent on the
如果把精力投入在

216
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,690
last station of the pipeline,
流水线的最后这个模块

217
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,840
you can improve the performance
那么系统的性能

218
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,500
of the systems as well.
还是能得到较大的提高

219
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,580
Another way of thinking about this
另一种认识这种分析方法的角度是

220
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,090
is that, by going through this
通过这样的分析

221
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,470
sort of analysis you're trying to
你就能总结出

222
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,640
figure out, you know, what is
改善每个模块的性能

223
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,700
the upside potential, of improving
系统的上升空间是多少

224
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,980
each of these components or how
或者说如果其中的某个模块

225
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,730
much could you possibly gain if
变得绝对完美时

226
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,910
one of these components became absolutely
你能得到什么收获

227
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,780
perfect and just really
这就像是给系统表现

228
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,230
places an upper bound on the performance of that system.
加上了一个提升的上限值

229
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,290
So, the idea of ceiling analysis is pretty important.
所以 上限分析的概念是很重要的

230
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,840
Let me just illustrate this idea again, but with a different example but a more complex one.
下面我再用一个稍微复杂一点的例子来演绎一下上限分析的原理

231
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,990
Let's say that you want to
假如说你想对这张图像

232
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,830
do face recognition from images,
进行人脸识别

233
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:35,960
so unless you want to look at
也就是说看着这张照片

234
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,650
the picture and recognize whether or
你希望识别出

235
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,770
not the person in this picture
照片里这个人

236
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,640
is a particular friend of yours,
是不是你的朋友

237
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,880
trying to recognize the person shown in this image.
希望辨识出图像中的人

238
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,260
This is a slightly artificial example.
这是一个偏人工智能的例子

239
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,080
This isn't actually how face
当然这并不是现实中的

240
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,790
recognition is done in
人脸识别技术

241
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,660
practice, but I want to step through an example of what a
但我想通过这个例子

242
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,800
pipeline might look like to
来向你展示一个流水线

243
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,220
give you another example of how
并且给你另一个关于

244
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,820
a ceiling analysis process might look.
上限分析的实例

245
00:07:58,710 --> 00:07:59,980
So, we have a
假如我们有张照片

246
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,830
camera image and let's say that we design a pipeline as follows.
我们设计了如下的流水线

247
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,120
Let's say the first thing you want
假如我们第一步要做的

248
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,480
to do is do pre-processing of
是图像预处理

249
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,770
the image, so let's take those
假如我们就用

250
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,310
images like I have shown on
右上角这张照片

251
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,040
the upper right, and let's say we
现在加入我们想要

252
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,510
want to remove the background, so
把背景去掉

253
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,790
through pre-processing the background disappears.
那么经过预处理 背景就被去掉了

254
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,820
Next we want to say detect the face of the person.
下一步我们希望检测出人脸的位置

255
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,550
That's usually done with a learning algorithm.
这通常通过一个学习算法来实现

256
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:21,960
So we'll run a sliding
我们会运行一个滑动窗分类器

257
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,900
windows crossfire to draw a box around the person's face.
在人脸上画一个框

258
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
Having detected the face it
在检测到脸部以后

259
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,650
turns out that if you
如果你想要

260
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,320
want to recognize people it turns
识别出这个人

261
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,630
out that the eyes is a highly useful cue.
那么眼睛是一个很重要的线索

262
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,860
We actually, in terms
事实上

263
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,420
ofrecognizing your friends, the
要辨认出你的朋友

264
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,870
appearance of their eyes is actually
你通常会看眼睛

265
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,680
one of the most important cues that you use.
这是个比较重要的线索

266
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,610
So let's run another crossfire to detect the eyes of the person.
所以 我们需要运行另一个分类器来检测人的眼睛

267
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,660
So, segment out the eyes,
分割出眼睛

268
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,650
and then and since this
这样就提供了

269
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,290
will give us useful features to
识别出一个人的

270
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,840
recognize a person, and then
很重要的特征

271
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,400
other parts of the face of physical interest.
然后继续识别脸上其他重要的部位

272
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,330
Maybe segment out the nose,
比如分割出鼻子

273
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,750
segment out the mouth, and
分割出嘴巴

274
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,230
then, having found the
这样找出了

275
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,060
eyes, the nose and the mouth,
眼睛、鼻子、嘴巴

276
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,420
all of these give us useful
所有这些都是非常有用的特征

277
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,920
features to maybe feed into
然后这些特征可以被输入给某个

278
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,540
a logistic regression crossfire.
逻辑回归的分类器

279
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,200
And it's the job of the
然后这个分类器的任务

280
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,420
crossfire to then give us the
就是给出最终的标签

281
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,850
overall label to find the
找出我们认为能

282
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,930
label for who we think
辨别出这个人是谁的

283
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,450
is the identity of this person.
最终的标签

284
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,730
So this is a kind of complicated pipeline.
这是一个稍微复杂一些的流水线

285
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,300
It's actually probably more complicated
如果你真的想识别出人的话

286
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,810
than you should be using, if you actually want to recognize people.
可能实际的流程比这个还要复杂

287
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,330
But there's an illustrative example that's useful to think about for ceiling analysis.
但这给出了很好的一个上限分析的例子

288
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,510
So how do you go through ceiling analysis for this pipeline?
对这个流水线怎么进行上限分析呢？

289
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,790
Well, we'll step through these pieces one at a time.
我们还是每次关注一个步骤

290
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:28,900
Let's say your overall system has
假如说你整个系统的准确率

291
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,560
85 percent accuracy, the first
达到了85%

292
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,670
thing I do is go to
那么我要做的第一件事情

293
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,890
my test set and manually
还是找到我的测试集

294
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,200
give it a ground foreground, background,
然后对前景和背景

295
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,090
segmentations, and then manually go to
进行分割

296
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,670
the test set, and use Photoshop
然后使用Photoshop

297
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,750
or something, to just tell it
或者别的什么软件

298
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,130
where's the background, and just
识别出哪些区域是背景

299
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,230
manually remove the background, so
然后手动把背景删掉

300
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,050
ground true background, and see how much the accuracy changes.
然后观察准确率提高多少

301
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,320
In this example, the accuracy
假设在这个例子中

302
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,700
goes up by 0.1%  so
准确率提高了0.1%

303
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,900
this is a strong sign that
这是个很明显的信号

304
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,240
even if you had perfect background
它告诉你即便你

305
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,680
segmentation your performance, even
把背景分割做得很好

306
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,650
if perfect background removal, the
完全去除了背景图案

307
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,740
performance of your system isn't going to go up that much.
但整个系统的表现也并不会提高多少

308
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,000
So this is maybe not worth a
所以似乎并不值得

309
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,720
huge effort to work on pre-processing, on background removal.
花太多精力在预处理或者背景移除上

310
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,170
Then, everything goes to the
接下来 再遍历测试集

311
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,290
test set, given the correct
给出正确的脸部识别图案

312
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:13,650
face detection images, then again
接下来还是依次运行

313
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,690
step through the eyes, nose, mouth segmentations in some order.
眼睛、鼻子和嘴巴的分割

314
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,470
Pick one order.
选择一种顺序就行了

315
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,890
Let's give the correct location

giving it the perfect face detection,
比如 有了完美的脸部识别

330
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,270
and it looks like the overall

337
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,600
there and three percent there.
这一步提高3%

338

347
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,580
And so, this tells us
