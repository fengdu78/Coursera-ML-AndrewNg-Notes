For logistic regression, we previously

(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,730
talked about two types of optimization algorithms.
我们在之前的课程已经学习过两种优化算法

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,190
We talked about how to use
我们首先学习了

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,210
gradient descent to optimize as cost function J of theta.
使用梯度下降法来优化代价函数 J(θ)

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,770
And we also talked about
接下来学习了

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,730
advanced optimization methods.
更高级的优化算法

7
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,670
Ones that require that you
这些高级优化算法

8
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,300
provide a way to compute
需要你自己设计

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,160
your cost function J of
代价函数 J(θ)

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,920
theta and that you provide a way to compute the derivatives.
自己计算导数

11
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:23,920
In this video, we'll show how
在本节课中

12
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,420
you can adapt both of
我们将展示

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,570
those techniques, both gradient descent and
如何改进梯度下降法和

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,350
the more advanced optimization techniques
高级优化算法

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,770
in order to have them
使其能够应用于

16
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,550
work for regularized logistic regression.
正则化的逻辑回归

17
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,670
So, here's the idea.
接下来我们来学习其中的原理

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,770
We saw earlier that Logistic
在之前的课程中我们注意到

19
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:40,490
Regression can also be prone
对于逻辑回归问题

20
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,540
to overfitting if you fit
有可能会出现过拟合的现象

21
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,090
it with a very, sort of,
如果你使用了

22
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,890
high order polynomial features like this.
类似这样的高阶多项式

23
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,250
Where G is the
g 是 S 型函数

24
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,970
sigmoid function and in
具体来说

25
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,330
particular you end up with
最后你会得到这样的结果

26
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,020
a hypothesis, you know,
最后你会得到这样的结果

27
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:54,120
whose decision bound to be
分类边界看起来是一个

28
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,930
just sort of an overly complex
过于复杂并且

29
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,600
and extremely contortive function that
十分扭曲的函数

30
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,680
really isn't such a great
针对这个训练点集

31
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,000
hypothesis for this training
这显然不是一个好的结果

32
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,990
set, and more generally if you have
通常情况下

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,890
logistic regression with a lot of features.
如果要解决的逻辑回归问题有很多参数

34
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,630
Not necessarily polynomial ones, but
并且又用了过多的多项式项

35
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,510
just with a lot of
这些项大部分都是没有必要的

36
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,720
features you can end up with overfitting.
最终都可能出现过拟合的现象

37
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,010
This was our cost function for logistic regression.
这是逻辑回归问题的代价函数

38
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,210
And if we want to modify
为了将其修改为正则化形式

39
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,820
it to use regularization, all we
为了将其修改为正则化形式

40
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,630
need to do is add to
我们只需要在后面增加一项

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,290
it the following term
我们只需要在后面增加一项

42
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,860
plus londer over 2M, sum
加上 λ/2m

43
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,580
from J equals 1, and
再跟过去一样

44
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:29,670
as usual sum from J equals 1.
这个求和将 j 从1开始

45
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
Rather than the sum from J
而不是从0开始

46
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,670
equals 0, of theta J squared.
累积 θj 的平方

47
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,470
And this has to
增加的这一项

48
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,960
effect therefore, of penalizing
将惩罚参数 θ1, θ2 等等

49
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,140
the parameters theta 1 theta
一直到 θn

50
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,600
2 and so on up to theta N from being too large.
防止这些参数取值过大

51
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,720
And if you do this,
增加了这一项之后

52
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,450
then it will the have the
产生的效果是

53
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,870
effect that even though you're fitting
即使用有很多参数的

54
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,500
a very high order polynomial with a lot of parameters.
高阶多项式来拟合

55
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,240
So long as you apply regularization
只要使用了正则化方法

56
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,090
and keep the parameters small
约束这些参数使其取值很小

57
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,580
you're more likely to get a decision boundary.
你仍有可能得到一条

58
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,040
You know, that maybe looks more like this.
看起来是这样的分类边界

59
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,460
It looks more reasonable for separating
显然  这条边界更合理地

60
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,740
the positive and the negative examples.
分开了正样本和负样本

61
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,970
So, when using regularization
因此  在使用了正则化方法以后

62
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:09,080
even when you have a lot
即使你的问题有很多参数

63
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,110
of features, the regularization can
正则化方法可以帮你

64
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,500
help take care of the overfitting problem.
避免过拟合的现象

65
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,790
How do we actually implement this?
这到底是怎样实现的呢？

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,280
Well, for the original gradient descent
首先看看以前学过的梯度下降法

67
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,380
algorithm, this was the update we had.
这是我们之前得到的更新式

68
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,300
We will repeatedly perform the following
我们利用这个式子

69
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,610
update to theta J. This
迭代更新 θj

70
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,940
slide looks a lot like the previous one for linear regression.
这一页幻灯片看起来和上一节课的线性回归问题很像

71
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,460
But what I'm going to do is
但是这里我将

72
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,390
write the update for theta 0 separately.
θ0 的更新公式单独写出来

73
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,930
So, the first line is
第一行用来更新 θ0

74
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,110
for update for theta 0 and
第一行用来更新 θ0

75
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,470
a second line is now
第二行用来更新

76
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,730
my update for theta 1
θ1 到 θn

77
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,470
up to theta N.
θ1 到 θn

78
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,740
Because I'm going to treat theta 0 separately.
将 θ0 单独处理

79
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,140
And in order to
为了按照

80
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,370
modify this algorithm, to use
正则化代价函数的形式

81
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,480
a regularized cos function,
来修改算法

82
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,510
all I need to do is
接下来的推导

83
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,810
pretty similar to what we
非常类似于

84
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,700
did for linear regression is
上一节学习过的正则化线性回归

85
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,620
actually to just modify this
只需要将第二个式子

86
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,480
second update rule as follows.
修改成这样

87
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,800
And, once again, this, you know,
我们又一次发现

88
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,080
cosmetically looks identical what
修改后的式子表面上看起来

89
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,720
we had for linear regression.
与上一节的线性回归问题很相似

90
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,580
But of course is not the
但是实质上这与

91
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,590
same algorithm as we had,
我们上节学过的算法并不一样

92
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,370
because now the hypothesis
因为现在的假设 h(x)

93
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,420
is defined using this.
是按照这个式子定义的

94
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,550
So this is not the same algorithm
这与上一节正则化线性回归算法

95
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,390
as regularized linear regression.
中的定义并不一样

96
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,340
Because the hypothesis is different.
由于假设的不同

97
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,360
Even though this update that I wrote down.
我写下的迭代公式

98
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,160
It actually looks cosmetically the
只是表面上看起来很像

99
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,130
same as what we had earlier.
上一节学过的

100
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,310
We're working out gradient descent for regularized linear regression.
正则化线性回归问题中的梯度下降算法

101
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:27,720
And of course, just to wrap
总结一下

102
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,360
up this discussion, this term
总结一下

103
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,860
here in the square
方括号中的这一项

104
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,330
brackets, so this term
方括号中的这一项

105
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,120
here, this term is,
这一项是

106
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,750
of course, the new partial
新的代价函数 J(θ)

107
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,590
derivative for respect of
关于 θj 的偏导数

108
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,420
theta J of the new cost function J of theta.
关于 θj 的偏导数

109
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,480
Where J of theta here is
这里的 J(θ)

110
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,980
the cost function we defined on
是我们在上一页幻灯片中

111
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,100
a previous slide that does use regularization.
定义的 使用了正则化的代价函数

112
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,060
So, that's gradient descent for regularized linear regression.
以上就是正则化逻辑回归问题的梯度下降算法

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,430
Let's talk about how to
接下来我们讨论

114
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,290
get regularized linear regression
如何在更高级的优化算法中

115
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,010
to work using the more
使用同样的

116
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,070
advanced optimization methods.
正则化技术

117
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,590
And just to remind you for
提醒一下

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,800
those methods what we needed
对于这些高级算法

119
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,390
to do was to define the
我们需要自己定义

120
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,460
function that's called the cost
costFuntion 函数

121
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,160
function, that takes us
这个函数有一个输入参数

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,660
input the parameter vector theta and
向量 theta

123
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,180
once again in the equations
theta 的内容是这样的

124
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,030
we've been writing here we used 0 index vectors.
我们的参数索引依然从0开始

125
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,690
So we had theta 0 up
即 θ0 到 θn

126
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,810
to theta N. But
但是由于 Octave 中

127
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,920
because Octave indexes the vectors starting from 1.
向量索引是从1开始

128
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,240
Theta 0 is written
我们的参数是从 θ0 到 θn

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,990
in Octave as theta 1.
在 Octave 里 是从 theta(1) 开始标号的

130
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,630
Theta 1 is written in
而 θ1 将被记为 theta(2)

131
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,930
Octave as theta 2, and
以此类推

132
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,070
so on down to theta
直到 θn 被记为

133
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,650
N plus 1.
theta(n+1)

134
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,450
And what we needed to
而我们需要做的

135
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
do was provide a function.
就是将这个自定义代价函数

136
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,370
Let's provide a function called
这个 costFunction 函数

137
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,140
cost function that we would
代入到我们之前学过的

138
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,920
then pass in to what we have, what we saw earlier.
代入到我们之前学过的

139
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,490
We will use the fminunc
fminunc函数中

140
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,310
and then
括号里面是 @costFunction

141
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,160
you know at cost function,
将 @costFunction 作为参数代进去

142
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,430
and so on, right.
等等

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,870
But the F min, u
fminunc返回的是

144
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,060
and c was the F min
函数 costFunction

145
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,310
unconstrained and this will
在无约束条件下的最小值

146
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,230
work with fminunc
因此  这个式子

147
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,300
was what will take
将求得代价函数的最小值

148
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,340
the cost function and minimize it for us.
将求得代价函数的最小值

149
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,050
So the two main things that
因此 costFunction 函数

150
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,600
the cost function needed to
有两个返回值

151
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,620
return were first J-val.
第一个是 jVal

152
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,400
And for that, we need
为此  我们要在这里

153
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,950
to write code to
补充代码

154
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,710
compute the cost function J of theta.
来计算代价函数 J(θ)

155
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,030
Now, when we're using regularized logistic
由于我们在这使用的是正则化逻辑回归

156
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,920
regression, of course the
因此

157
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,960
cost function j of theta
代价函数 J(θ) 也相应需要改变

158
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,450
changes and, in particular,
具体来说

159
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
now a cost function needs to
代价函数需要

160
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,580
include this additional regularization term at the end as well.
增加这一正则化项

161
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,930
So, when you compute j of
因此  当你在计算 J(θ) 时

162
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,410
theta be sure to include that term at the end.
需要确保包含了最后这一项

163
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,520
And then, the other thing that
另外 代价函数的

164
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,240
this cost function thing
另一项返回值是

165
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,010
needs to derive with a gradient.
对应的梯度导数

166
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,170
So gradient one needs
梯度的第一个元素

167
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,570
to be set to the
gradient(1) 就等于

168
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,080
partial derivative of J
J(θ) 关于 θ0 的偏导数

169
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,520
of theta with respect to theta
J(θ)关于θ0的偏导数

170
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,170
zero, gradient two needs
梯度的第二个元素按照这个式子计算

171
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,520
to be set to that, and so on.
剩余元素以此类推

172
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,900
Once again, the index is off by one.
再次强调 向量元素索引是从1开始

173
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,850
Right, because of the indexing from
这是因为 Octave 的向量索引

174
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,450
one Octave users.
就是从1开始的

175
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,780
And looking at these terms.
再来总结一下

176
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:58,680
This term over here.
首先看第一个公式

177
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,640
We actually worked this out
在之前的课程中

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,840
on a previous slide is actually equal to this.
我们已经计算过它等于这个式子

179
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:03,640
It doesn't change.
这个式子没有变化

180
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,250
Because the derivative for theta zero doesn't change.
因为相比没有正则化的版本

181
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,540
Compared to the version without regularization.
J(θ) 关于 θ0 的偏导数不会改变

182
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,210
And the other terms do change.
但是其他的公式确实有变化

183
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,340
And in particular the derivative respect to theta one.
以 θ1 的偏导数为例

184
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,830
We worked this out on the previous slide as well.
在之前的课程里我们也计算过这一项

185
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,670
Is equal to, you know,
它等于这个式子

186
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,560
the original term and then minus
减去 λ 除以 m (这里应为加 校对者注)

187
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,870
londer M times theta 1.
再乘以 θ1

188
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,140
Just so we make sure we pass this correctly.
注意要确保这段代码编写正确

189
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,370
And we can add parentheses here.
建议在这里添加括号

190
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,980
Right, so the summation doesn't extend.
防止求和符号的作用域扩大

191
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,160
And similarly, you know,
类似的

192
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,800
this other term here looks
再来看这个式子

193
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,180
like this, with this additional
相比于之前的幻灯片

194
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,950
term that we had on
这里多了额外的一项

195
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,770
