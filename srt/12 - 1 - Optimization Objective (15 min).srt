00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:04,860
of different learning algorithms. Within supervised learning,

00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,190
is small there will often be
应用这些算法时

10
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,100
things like the amount of data
所创建的

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,530
you are creating these algorithms on.

That's always your skill in

choose the regularization parameter
以及如何选择正则化参数

18

and things like that. But there's
诸如此类的事

19
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,110
one more algorithm that is very

widely used both within industry

support vector machine, and compared to
它被称为支持向量机(Support Vector Machine)

And so I'd like to take the next

videos to
我会探讨

31
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,100
talk about that.
这一算法

32
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Later in this course, I will do
在稍后的课程中

33
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,710
a quick survey of the range
我也会对监督学习算法

34
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,340
of different supervised learning algorithms just
进行简要的总结

35
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,790
to very briefly describe them
当然  仅仅是作简要描述

36
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,870
but the support vector machine, given

00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,920
it is, this will be
在本课中 我会花许多时间来讲解它

39
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,800
the last of the supervised learning algorithms
它也是我们所介绍的

40
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,710
that I'll spend a significant amount of time on in this course.
最后一个监督学习算法

41
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,440
As with our development of ever
正如我们之前开发的学习算法

42
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,280
learning algorithms, we are going to start by talking
我们从

43
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,940
about the optimization objective,
优化目标开始

44
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,420
so let's get started on
那么 我们开始学习

45
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,920
this algorithm.
这个算法

46
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,960
In order to describe the support
为了描述支持向量机

47
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,570
vector machine, I'm actually going
事实上 我将会

48
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,020
to start with logistic regression
从逻辑回归开始

49
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,990
and show how we can modify
展示我们如何

50
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,630
it a bit and get what
一点一点修改

51
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,260
is essentially the support vector machine.
来得到本质上的支持向量机

52
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,740
So, in logistic regression we have
那么 在逻辑回归中

53
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,680
our familiar form of
我们已经熟悉了

54
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,000
the hypotheses there and the
这里的假设函数形式

55
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,590
sigmoid activation function shown on the right.
和右边的S型激励函数

56
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,330
And in order to explain
然而 为了解释

57
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,650
some of the math, I'm going
一些数学知识

58
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,960
to use z to denote failure of transpose x here.
我将用 z 表示 θ 转置乘以 x

59
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,650
Now let's think about what
现在 让一起考虑下

60
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,150
we will like the logistic regression to do.
我们想要逻辑回归做什么

61
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,800
If we have an example with
如果有一个

62
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,360
y equals 1, and by
y=1 的样本

63
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,480
this I mean an example
我的意思是

64
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,100
in either a training set
不管是在训练集中 或是在测试集中

65
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,780
or the test set, you know, order cross valuation set where y is equal to 1 then
又或者在交叉验证集中 总之是 y=1

66
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,300
we are sort of hoping that h of x will be close to 1.
现在 我们希望 h(x) 趋近1

67
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,760
So, right, we are hoping to
因为 我们想要

68
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,330
correctly classify that example
正确地将此样本分类

69
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,390
and what, having h of x
这就意味着

70
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,710
close to 1, what that means
当 h(x) 趋近于1时

71
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,080
is that theta transpose x
θ 转置乘以 x

72
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,380
must be much larger
应当

73
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,990
than 0, so there's
远大于0 这里的

74
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,680
greater than, greater than sign, that
大于大于号 >>

75
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,220
means much, much greater
意思是

76
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,880
than 0 and that's
远远大于0

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,840
because it is z, that is theta transpose
这是因为 由于 z 表示

78
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,750
x
θ 转置乘以 x

79
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,910
is when z is much bigger than
当 z 远大于

80
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,240
0, is far to the
0时 即到了

81
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,060
right of this figure that, you know, the
该图的右边 你不难发现

82
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,430
output of logistic regression becomes close to 1.
此时逻辑回归的输出将趋近于1

83
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,580
Conversely, if we have
相反地 如果我们

84
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,870
an example where y is
有另一个样本

85
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,470
equal to 0 then what
即 y=0

86
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,620
were hoping for is that the hypothesis
我们希望假设函数

87
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,890
will output the value to
的输出值

88
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,850
close to 0 and that corresponds to theta transpose x
将趋近于0 这对应于 θ 转置乘以 x

89
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,990
or z pretty much
或者就是 z 会

90
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,080
less than 0 because
远小于0

91
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,720
that corresponds to
因为对应的

92
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,250
hypothesis of outputting a value close to 0. If
假设函数的输出值趋近0

93
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,590
you look at the
如果你进一步

94
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,300
cost function of logistic regression, what
观察逻辑回归的代价函数

95
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,470
you find is that each
你会发现

96
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,400
example x, y,
每个样本 (x, y)

97
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,520
contributes a term like
都会为总代价函数

98
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,320
this to the overall cost function.
增加这里的一项

99
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,900
All right. So, for the overall cost function, we usually, we will
因此 对于总代价函数

100
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,600
also have a sum over
通常会有对所有的训练样本求和

101
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,430
all the training examples and 1 over m term.
并且这里还有一个1/m项

102
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:22,740
But this
但是

103
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,150
expression here. That's
在逻辑回归中

104
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,450
the term that a single
这里的这一项

105
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,490
training example contributes to
就是表示一个训练样本

106
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,550
the overall objective function for logistic regression.
所对应的表达式

107
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,350
Now, if I take the definition
现在 如果我将完整定义的

108
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,120
for the full of my hypothesis
假设函数

109
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,700
and plug it in, over here,
代入这里

110
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,710
the one I get is that
那么 我们就会得到

111
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,130
each training example contributes this term, right?
每一个训练样本都影响这一项

112
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,480
Ignoring the 1 over
现在 先忽略1/m这一项

113
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,130
m but it contributes that term
但是这一项

114
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,470
to be my overall cost function for
是影响整个总代价函数

115
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,260
logistic regression. Now let's
中的这一项的

116
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,310
consider the 2 cases
现在 一起来考虑两种情况

117
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,970
of when y is equal to 1
一种是y等于1的情况

118
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,250
and when y is equal to 0.
一种是y等于0的情况

119
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,040
In the first case, let's
在第一种情况中

120
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,260
suppose that y is equal
假设 y

121
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,960
to 1. In that case,
等于1 此时

122
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,850
only this first row in
在目标函数中

123
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,910
the objective matters because this
只需有第一项起作用

124
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,830
1 minus y term will be equal
因为y等于1时

125
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,510
to 0 if y is equal to 1.
(1-y) 项将等于0

126
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,340
So, when y is equal to
因此 当在y等于

127
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,130
1 when in an example, x,
1的样本中时

128
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,240
y when y is equal to
即在 (x, y) 中

129
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,840
1, what we get is this
y等于1

130
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,340
term minus log 1
我们得到

131
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,370
over 1 plus e to the negative
-log(1/(1+e^z) ) 这样一项

132
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,050
z. Where, similar to the last slide,
这里同上一张幻灯片一致

133
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,480
I'm using z to denote
我用 z

134
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,430
data transpose x.  And
表示 θ 转置乘以 x

135
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,930
of course, in the cost we
当然 在代价函数中

136
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,130
actually had this minus y
y 前面有负号

137
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,490
but we just said that you know, if y is
我们只是这样表示

138
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,790
equal to 1. So that's equal
如果y等于1 代价函数中

139
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,500
to 1. I just simplified it
这一项也等于1 这样做

140
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,010
a way in the expression that
是为了简化

141
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,820
I have written down here.
此处的表达式

142
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,030
And if we plot this function,
如果画出

143
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,080
as a function of z, what
关于 z 的函数

144
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,320
you find is that you get
你会看到

145
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,630
this curve shown on the
左下角的

146
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,290
lower left of this line
这条曲线

147
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,290
and thus we also see
我们同样可以看到

148
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,590
that when z is equal
当 z 增大时

149
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,930
to large that is to when
也就是相当于

150
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,930
theta transpose x is large
θ 转置乘以x 增大时

151
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,790
that corresponds to a
z 对应的值

152
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,900
value of z that gives
会变的非常小

153
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,050
us a very small value, a very
对整个代价函数而言

154
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,650
small contribution to the
影响也非常小

155
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,120
cost function and this
这也就解释了

156
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,790
kind of explains why when
为什么

157
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,020
logistic regression sees a positive example
逻辑回归在观察到

158
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,200
with y equals 1 it tries
正样本 y=1 时

159
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,220
to set theta transpose x
试图将 θ^T*x

160
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,810
to be very large because that
设置的非常大

161
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,440
corresponds to this term
因为 在代价函数中的

162
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,490
in a cost function being small. Now, to build
这一项会变的非常小 现在

163
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,640
the Support Vector Machine, here is what we are going to do.
开始建立支持向量机 我们从这里开始

164
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,780
We are going to take this cost function, this
我们会从这个代价函数开始

165
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,420
minus log 1 over 1 plus e to the negative z and modify it a little bit.
也就是 -log(1/(1+e^z)) 一点一点修改

166
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,450
Let me take this point
让我取这里的

167
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,120
1 over here and let
z=1 点

168
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,200
me draw the course function that I'm going to
我先画出将要用的代价函数

169
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,510
use, the new cost function is gonna
新的代价函数将会

170
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,320
be flat from here on out
水平的从这里到右边 (图外)

171
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,980
and then I'm going to draw something
然后我再画一条

172
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,720
that grows as a straight
同逻辑回归

173
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,230
line similar to logistic
非常相似的直线

174
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,710
regression but this is going to be the
但是 在这里

175
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,740
straight line in this posh inning.
是一条直线

176
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,040
So the curve that
也就是 我用紫红色画的曲线

177
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,580
I just drew in magenta. The curve that I just drew purple and magenta.
就是这条紫红色的曲线

178
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,580
So, it's a pretty
那么 到了这里

179
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,840
close approximation to the
已经非常接近

180
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,480
cost function used by logistic
逻辑回归中

181
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,060
regression except that it is
使用的代价函数了

182
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,590
now made out of two line segments. This
只是这里是由两条线段组成

183
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,110
is flat potion on the right
即位于右边的水平部分

184
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,590
and then this is a straight
和位于左边的

185
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,340
line portion on the
直线部分

186
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,460
left. And don't worry too much about the slope of the straight line portion.
先别过多的考虑左边直线部分的斜率

187
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,930
It doesn't matter that
这并不是很重要

188
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,630
much but that's the
但是 这里

189
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,910
new cost function we're going to use where y is equal to 1 and
我们将使用的新的代价函数 是在 y=1 的前提下的

190
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,240
you can imagine you
你也许能想到

191
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,310
should do something pretty similar to logistic regression
这应该能做同逻辑回归中类似的事情

192
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,470
but it turns out that this will give the
但事实上

193
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,630
support vector machine computational advantage
在之后的的优化问题中

194
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,470
that will give us later on
这会变得更坚定 并且为支持向量机

195
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,190
an easier optimization problem, that
带来计算上的优势

196
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,670
will be easier for stock trades and so on.
例如 更容易计算股票交易的问题 等等

197
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,990
We just talked about the case
目前 我们只是讨论了

198
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,300
of y equals to 1. The other
y=1 的情况 另外

199
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,420
case is if y is equal
一种情况是当

200
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,120
to 0. In that case,
y=0 时 此时

201
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,870
if you look at the cost
如果你仔细观察代价函数

202
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,880
then only this second term
只留下了第二项

203
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,470
will apply because the first
因为第一项

204
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,800
term goes a way
被消除了

205
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,490
where if y is equal to 0 then nearly
如果当 y=0 时 那么

206
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,670
it was 0 here. So
这一项也就是0了

207
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,640
your left only with the second
所以上述表达式

208
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,100
term of the expression above
只留下了第二项

209
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,600
and so the cost of an
因此 这个样本的代价

210
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,960
example or the contribution
或是代价函数的贡献

211
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,620
of the cost function is going
将会由

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,850
to be given by this term
这一项表示

213
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,620
over here and if you
并且 如果你将

214
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:07,860
plug that as a function
这一项作为 z 的函数

215
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,750
z. So, I have here z on the
那么 这里就会得到横轴z

216
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,290
horizontal axis, you end up
现在 你完成了

217
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,370
with this group and for
支持向量机中的部分内容

218
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,570
the support vector machine, once
同样地 再来一次

219
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,540
again we're going to replace
我们要替代这一条蓝色的线

220
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,860
this blue line with something similar
用相似的方法

221
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,060
and see if we can
如果我们用

222
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,220
replace it with a new cost, there
一个新的代价函数来代替

223
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,910
is flat out here. There's 0 out here and then
即这条从0点开始的水平直线

224
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,230
it grows as a straight
然后是一条斜线

225
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:27,900
line like so.
像这样

226
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,710
So, let me give
那么 现在让我给

227
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,950
these two functions names.
这两个方程命名

228
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:33,910
This function on the left, I'm
左边的函数

229
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,850
going to call
我称之为

230
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,360
cost subscript 1 of z.
cost1(z)

231
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,650
And this function on the right, I'm going to call
同时 在右边函数

232
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,700
cost subscript 0
我称它为 cost0(z)

233
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,260
of z. And the subscript just refers
这里的下标是指

234
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,740
to the cost corresponding to
在代价函数中

235
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,570
y is equal to 1 versus y is equal to 0.
对应的 y=1 和 y=0 的情况

236
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,470
Armed with these definitions, we are
拥有了这些定义后

237
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,730
now ready to build the support vector machine.
现在 我们就开始构建支持向量机

238
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,030
Here is the cost function
这是我们在逻辑回归中使用

239
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,230
j of theta that we have for
代价函数 J(θ)

240
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,440
logistic regression. In case
也许这个方程

241
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,760
this the equation looks a
看起来不是非常熟悉

242
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,220
bit unfamiliar is because previously we
这是因为 之前

243
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,270
had a minor sign outside, but
有个负号在方程外面

244
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,820
here what I did was I
但是 这里我所做的是

245
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,010
instead moved the minor signs
将负号移到了

246
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,800
inside this expression. So it
表达式的里面

247
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,920
just, you know, makes it look a
这样做使得方程

248
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,970
little more different. For the support
看起来有些不同

249
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,670
vector machine what we are
对于支持向量机而言

250
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,550
going to do is essentially take
实质上 我们要将这一

251
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,460
this, and replace this with
替换为

252
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,260
cost 1 of z,
cost1(z)

253
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,060
that is cost 1 of theta transpose x.
也就是cost1(θ^T*x)

254
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm going
同样地 我也将

255
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,250
to take this and replace it with cost
这一项替换为cost0(z)

256
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,420
0 of z. This is cost 0 of
也就是代价

257
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,090
theta transpose x
cost0(θ^T*x)

258
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,680
where the cost 1 function is
这里的代价函数 cost1

259
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,740
what we had on the previous
就是之前所提到的那条线

260
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,930
line that looks like this and
看起来是这样的

261
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,540
the cost 0 function, again what
此外 代价函数 cost0

262
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,420
we have on the previous line that
也是上面所介绍过的那条线

263
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,730
looks like this.
看起来是这样

264
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,080
So, what we have for the support
因此 对于支持向量机

265
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,360
vector machine is an minimizationminimalization
我们得到了这里的最小化问题

266
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,220
problem of one of
即 1/m 乘以

267
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,210
1 over m, sum over
从1加到第 m 个

268
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,650
my training examples of y(i) times cost
训练样本 y(i) 再乘以

269
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,050
1 of theta transpose
cost1(θ^T*x(i))

270
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,910
x(i) plus 1 minus
加上1减去

271
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,640
y(i) times cost zero of theta transpose x(i).
y(i) 乘以 cost0(θ^T*x(i))

272
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,490
And then
然后

273
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,470
plus my usual regularization
再加上正则化参数

274
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,280
parameter like so. Now
像这样

275
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,280
by convention for the Support
现在 按照支持向量机的惯例

276
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,610
Vector Machine, we actually write
事实上 我们的书写

277
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,510
things slightly differently. We parametrize
会稍微有些不同

278
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,690
this just very slightly differently.
代价函数的参数表示也会稍微有些不同

279
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,720
First, we're going
首先 我们要

280
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,360
to get rid of the 1
除去 1/m 这一项

281
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,860
over m terms and this just,
当然 这仅仅是

282
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,480
this just happens
仅仅是由于

283
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,380
to be a slightly different convention that people
人们使用支持向量机时

284
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,930
use for support vector machines
对比于逻辑回归而言

285
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,400
compared to for logistic regression. But here's what
不同的习惯所致 但这里我所说的意思是

286
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,180
I mean, you know, what I'm going
你知道 我将要做的是

287
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,960
to do is I am just gonna get
仅仅除去

288
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,450
rid  of this 1 over m
1/m 这一项

289
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,860
terms and this should give
但是 这也会得出

290
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,030
me the same optimal value for theta, right.
同样的θ最优值 好的

291
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,020
Because 1 over m is just a constant.
因为 1/m 仅是个常量

292
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,550
So, you know, whether I solve
因此 你知道

293
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,410
this minimization problem with 1
在这个最小化问题中

294
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,430
over m in front or not,
无论前面是否有 1/m 这一项

295
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,010
I should end up with the same
最终我所得到的

296
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,510
optimal value of theta.
最优值θ都是一样的

297
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,450
Here is what I mean, to
这里我的意思是

298
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,000
give you a concrete example,
先给你举一个实例

299
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,170
suppose I had a minimization
假定有一最小化问题

300
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,040
problem that you know minimize over
即要求当 (u-5)^2+1

301
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,700
a real number u of u minus 5 squared,
取得最小值时的 u 值

302
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,540
plus 1, right. Well, the
好的

303
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,040
minimum of this happens, happens
这时最小值为

304
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,900
to know the minimum of this is u equals 5.
当 u=5 时取得最小值

305
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,980
Now if I want to take
现在 如果我们想要

306
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,800
this objective function and multiply
将这个目标函数

307
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,240
it by 10, so
乘上常数10

308
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,850
here my minimization problem is
这里我的最小化问题就变成了

309
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,510
minimum of u of 10, u minus
求使得 10×(u-5)^2+10

310
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,270
5 squared plus 10.
最小的值u

311
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,650
Well the value of u
然而 这里的u值

312
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,350
that minimizes this is still u equals 5, right.
使得这里最小的u值仍为5

313
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,540
So, multiplying something that
因此 将一些常数

314
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
you are minimizing over by some
乘以你的最小化项

315
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,540
constant, 10 in this case,
例如 这里的常数10

316
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,710
it does not change the value
这并不会改变

317
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,450
of u that gives us, that minimizes this function.
最小化该方程时得到u值

318
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,680
So the same way what I've
因此 这里我所做的

319
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,120
done by crossing out this
是删去常量m

320
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,940
m is, all I
也是相同的

321
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,770
am doing is multiplying my objective
现在 我将目标函数

322
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,650
function by some constant m
乘上一个常量 m

323
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,920
and it doesn't change the value
并不会改变

324
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,310
of theta that achieves the minimum.
取得最小值时的 θ 值

325
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,190
The second bit of notational change,
第二点概念上的变化

326
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,560
we're just designating the most
我们只是指在使用

327
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,630
standard convention, when using as
支持向量机时 一些如下的标准惯例

328
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,250
the SVM, instead of logistic regression as a following.
而不是逻辑回归

329
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,880
So, for logistic regression, we had
因此 对于逻辑回归

330
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,270
two terms to our objective function.
在目标函数中 我们有两项

331
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,500
The first is this term
第一个是这一项

332
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,020
which is the cost that comes
是来自于

333
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,910
from the training set and the
训练样本的代价

334
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,730
second is this term, which
第二个是这一项

335
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,330
is the regularization term
是我们的正则化项

336
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,460
and what we had, we had to
我们不得不去

337
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,900
control the trade off between
用这一项来平衡

338
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,600
these by saying, you know, that we
这就相当于

339
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,760
wanted to minimize A plus
我们想要最小化 A 加上

340
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,240
and then my regularization parameter lambda,
正则化参数 λ

341
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,280
and then times some other
然后乘以

342
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,430
term B, right? Where as I
其他项 B 对吧？

343
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,970
am using A to denote
这里的 A 表示

344
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,160
this first term, and I am
这里的第一项

345
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,280
using B to denote that
同时 我用 B 表示

346
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,560
second term, may be without the
第二项 但不包括 λ

347
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,440
lambda, and instead of
我们不是

348
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,090
prioritizing this as A plus lambda B,
优化这里的 A+λ×B

349
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,950
we could, and so what we
我们所做的

350
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,670
did was by setting different
是通过设置

351
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,210
values for this regularization parameter lambda.
不同正则参数 λ 达到优化目的

352
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,180
We could trade off the relative
这样 我们就能够权衡

353
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,720
way between how much we
对应的项

354
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,780
want to fit the training set well,
是使得训练样本拟合的更好

355
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,390
as minimizing A, versus how
即最小化 A

356
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,930
much we care about keeping the values of the parameters small.
还是保证正则参数足够小

357
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,530
So that would be
也即是

358
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,170
for the parameters B. For the Support
对于B项而言

359
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,620
Vector Machine, just by convention
但对于支持向量机 按照惯例

360
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,150
we're going to use a different
我们将使用一个不同的参数

361
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,960
parameter. So instead of using lambda here
为了替换这里使用的 λ

362
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,220
to control the relative
来权衡这两项

363
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,730
waiting between you know, the first and second terms,
你知道 就是第一项和第二项

364
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,260
we are
我们

365
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,370
still going to use a different
依照惯例使用

366
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,070
parameter which by convention
一个不同的参数

367
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,530
is called C and
称为C

368
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,550
we instead are going to minimize C times
同时改为优化目标

369
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,160
A plus B. So
C×A+B

370
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,210
for logistic regression if we
因此 在逻辑回归中

371
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,730
send a very large value of
如果给定 λ

372
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,980
lambda, that means to give
一个非常大的值

373
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,970
B a very high weight. Here
意味着给予B更大的权重

374
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,640
is that if we set C
而这里 就对应于将C

375
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,750
to be a very small value. That
设定为非常小的值

376
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,510
corresponds to giving B
那么 相应的将会给 B

377
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,530
much larger weight than C than A.
比给 A 更大的权重

378
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,730
So this is just a different
因此 这只是

379
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,330
way of controlling the trade off
一种不同的方式来控制这种权衡

380
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,970
or just a different way of
或者一种不同的方法

381
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,530
parametrizing how much we care about optimizing the first term versus how much we care about optimizing the second term.
即用参数来决定 是更关心第一项的优化 还是更关心第二项的优化

382
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,250
And if you want you can
当然你也可以

383
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,620
think of this as the parameter
把这里的参数C

384
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,580
C playing a role
考虑成 1/λ

385
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,570
similar to 1 over
同 1/λ 所扮演的

386
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,900
lambda and it's
角色相同

387
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,100
not that it's two equations
并且这两个方程

388
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,900
or these two expressions will be
或这两个表达式并不相同

389
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,500
equal, it's equals 1 over
因为 C 等于 1/λ

390
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,350
lambda and it's not that these two equations or these two expressions will be equal. It's equals t 1 over lambda. That's not the case where it bothers that if C is equal to 1 over lambda then
但是也并不全是这样 如果当C等于 1/λ 时

391
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,510
these
这两个

392
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,670
two optimization objectives should
优化目标应当

393
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,260
give you the same value, same
得到相同的值

394
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,460
optimal value of theta. So
相同的最优值θ 因此

395
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,180
just filling that
就用它们来代替

396
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,030
in. I'm gonna cross out lambda here
那么 我现在删掉这里的 λ

397
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,940
and write in the constant C there.
并且用常数 C 来代替这里

398
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,930
So,that's gives
因此 这就得到了

399
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,830
us our overall optimization objective
在支持向量机中

400
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,650
function for the Support Vector
我们的整个优化目标函数

401
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,970
Machine and where you
然后最小化

402
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,200
minimize that function then what
这个目标函数

403
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,410
you have is the parameters
得到 SVM 学习到的

404
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,800
learned by SVM. Finally on
参数C 最后

405
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,690
light of logistic regression, the Support
有别于逻辑回归

406
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,110
Vector Machine doesn't output the
有别于逻辑回归

407
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,850
probability. Instead what we
输出的概率 在这里

408
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,910
have is, we have this cost
我们的代价函数

409
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,600
function which we minimize to
当最小化代价函数

410
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,770
get the parameters theta and what
获得参数θ时

411
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,900
the Support Vector Machine does,
支持向量机所做的是

412
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,970
is it just makes the prediction
它来直接预测

413
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,650
of y being equal 1
y的值等于1

414
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,390
or 0 directly. So the hypothesis,
还是等于0 因此 这个假设函数

415
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,920
where I predict, 1, if
会预测1

416
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,630
theta transpose x is
当 θ^T*x 大于

417
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,680
greater than or equal to
或者等于0时

418
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,060
0 and I'll predict 0 otherwise.
或者等于0时

419
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,560
And so, having learned the
所以学习

420
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,010
parameters theta, this is
参数 θ

421
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,980
the form of the hypothesis for the support vector machine.
就是支持向量机假设函数的形式

422
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,870
So, that was a
那么 这就是

423
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,670
mathematical definition of what
支持向量机

424
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,520
a support vector machine does.
数学上的定义

In the next few videos, let's
再接下来的视频中

426
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,900
try to get back to
让我们再回去

427
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,030
intuition about what this
从直观的角度看看优化目标

428
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,660
optimization objective leads to and
实际上是在做什么

429
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,840
whether the source of the hypothesis
以及 SVM 的假设函数

430
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,300
a SVM will learn and also
将会学习什么

431
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,060
talk about how to modify
同时 也会谈谈 如何

432
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,640
this just a little bit to
做些许修改

433
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,280
learn complex, nonlinear functions.
学习更加复杂、非线性的函数
