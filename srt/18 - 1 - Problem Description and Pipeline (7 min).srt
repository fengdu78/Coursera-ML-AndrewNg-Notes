that text region, we can
矩形轮廓

106
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,930
then do character segmentation, where
我们可以进行字符切分

107
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,210
we might take this text box
比如对这个文字框

108
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,310
that says "Antique Mall" and
我们或许能认出“ANTIQUE MALL”

109
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,760
try to segment it out
然后我们会试着将其

110
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,150
into the locations of the individual characters.
分割成独立的字符

111
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,280

113
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,040
then run a crossfire, which
我们可以运行一个分类器

114
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,950
looks at the images of the
输入这些可识别的字符

115
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,620

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,990
figure out the first character's an

N, the third character is
第三个字母是一个T

119
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,930
a T, and so on,
等等

120
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,130
so that up by doing all

124
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,760
and similarly for some of
然后图片中其他有文字的地方

125
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,690
the other words that appear in that image.
也是类似的方法进行处理

126
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,390
I should say that there are some photo OCR systems
实际上有很多照片OCR系统

127
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,350
that do even more complex things,
会进行更为复杂的处理

128
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,370
like a bit of spelling correction at the end.
比如在最后会进行拼写校正

129
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,470
So if, for example, your

134
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,930
n i n g. Then,
那么

135
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,570
you know, a sort of spelling
很多拼写修正系统

136
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,910
correction system might tell
