Now if you have a
现在假定你有一个

94
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:01,835

98
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,170
is going to, you know, keep on
将会一直继续

99
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,911

102
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:17,950
will come and for
偶然访问

103
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,576
the user that comes we'll get
然后我们将会得到

104
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:25,380
some x,y pair corresponding to
与其对应的一些(x,y)对

105
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,096
a customer or to a user on the website.
这些(x,y)对是相对应于一个特定的客户或用户的

106
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:30,884
So the features x are, you

107
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:32,811
know, the origin and destination specified
客户所指定的起始地与目的地

108
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:34,111

112
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,148
zero depending one whether or
y值取决于

113
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:41,518
not they chose to

use our shipping service.
使用我们的运输服务

115
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,419
Now once we get this {x,y}
现在我们一旦获得了这个{x,y}数据对

116
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:46,813
pair, what an online
在线学习算法

117
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,391
learning algorithm does is then
要做的就是

118
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,690
update the parameters theta
更新参数θ

119
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,011
using just this example
利用刚得到的(x,y)数据对来更新θ

120
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:57,726
x,y, and in particular
具体来说

121
00:03:57,726 --> 00:03:59,839
we would update my parameters theta
我们将这样更新我们的参数θ

122
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,842
as Theta j get updated as Theta j
θj 将会被更新为

123
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:06,619
minus the learning rate alpha times
θj 减去学习率 α 乘以

124
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:11,356
my usual gradient descent
梯度下降

125
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:13,399
rule for logistic regression.
来做逻辑回归

126
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,491
So we do this for j
然后我们对j等于0到n

127
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:15,652
equals zero up to n,
重复这个步骤

128
00:04:15,652 --> 00:04:19,088
and that's my close curly brace.
这是我的另一边花括号

129
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:21,218
So, for other learning algorithms
所以对于其他的学习算法

130
00:04:21,218 --> 00:04:22,873
instead of writing X-Y, right, I
不是写(x,y)对 对吧

131
00:04:22,873 --> 00:04:24,011
was writing things like Xi,
我之前写的是

132
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,495
Yi but
(x(i),y(i)) 一样的数据对

133
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,842
in this online learning setting
但在这个在线学习机制中

134
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:29,723
where actually discarding the notion
我们实际上丢弃了

135
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:31,464
of there being a fixed training
获取一个固定的数据集这样的概念

136
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,904
set instead we have an algorithm.
取而代之的是 我们拥有一个算法

137
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:34,924
Now what happens as we get
现在 当我们

138
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:37,014
an example and then we
获取一个样本 然后我们

139
00:04:37,014 --> 00:04:38,825
learn using that example like
利用那个样本获取信息学习

140
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:41,031
so and then we throw that example away.
然后我们丢弃这个样本

141
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,098
We discard that example and we
我们丢弃那个样本 而且我们

142
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:45,141
never use it again and
永远不会再使用它

143
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,161
so that's why we just look at one example at a time.
这就是为什么我们在一个时间点只会处理一个样本的原因

144
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,879
We learn from that example.
我们从样本中学习

145
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,412
We discard it.
我们再丢弃它

146
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:51,527
Which is why, you know, we're
这也就是为什么

147
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:52,943
also doing away with this
我们放弃了一种拥有

148
00:04:52,943 --> 00:04:54,615
notion of there being this
我们放弃了一种拥有

149
00:04:54,615 --> 00:04:58,191
sort of fixed training set indexed by i.
固定的 由 i 来作参数的数据集的表示方法

150
00:04:58,191 --> 00:04:59,328
And, if you really run
而且 如果你真的运行

151
00:04:59,328 --> 00:05:01,488
a major website where you
一个大型网站

152
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,624
really have a continuous stream
在这个网站里你有一个连续的

153
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:05,737
of users coming, then this
用户流登陆网站 那么

154
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:07,525
sort of online learning algorithm
这种在线学习算法

155
00:05:07,525 --> 00:05:10,358
is actually a pretty reasonable algorithm.
是一种非常合理的算法

156
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,076
Because of data is essentially
因为数据本质上是自由的

157
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:13,330
free if you have so
如果你有如此多的数据

158
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,979
much data, that data
而数据

159
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,022
is essentially unlimited then there
本质上是无限的 那么

160
00:05:17,022 --> 00:05:17,997
is really may be no
或许就真的没必要

161
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:18,949
need to look at a
重复处理

162
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,527
training example more than once.
一个样本

163
