2
00:00:01,364 --> 00:00:02,699
to start talking about how to
讨论如何

3
00:00:02,699 --> 00:00:05,020
multiply together two matrices.
将两个矩阵相乘

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,618
We'll start with a special case
我们将从矩阵相乘的

5
00:00:06,618 --> 00:00:08,347
of that, of matrix vector
特例  向量相乘开始

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,530
multiplication -  multiplying a matrix together with a vector.
即 一个矩阵与一个向量相乘

7
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,975
Let's start with an example.
让我们从一个示例开始

8
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,722
Here is a matrix,
左边是一个矩阵

9
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:17,283
and here is a vector, and
右边是一个向量

10
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,351
let's say we want to
假设我们要

11
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,281
multiply together this matrix
将这个矩阵

12
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:24,202
with this vector, what's the result?
与这个向量相乘 结果会怎样呢？

13
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:25,209
Let me just work through this
我先快速计算出结果

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,058
example and then we
然后我们再

15
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:29,886
can step back and look at just what the steps were.
退回去 查看每一个步骤

16
00:00:29,886 --> 00:00:31,104
It turns out the result of
很明显 相乘的结果

17
00:00:31,104 --> 00:00:32,912
this multiplication process is going
将是

18
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:34,554
to be, itself, a vector.
一个向量

19
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,931
And I'm just going work
我先将这部分完成

20
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,108
with this first and later we'll
然后再来解释

21
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,650
come back and see just what I did here.
我刚刚是怎么做的

22
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:41,228
To get the first element of
要计算出结果向量的第一个元素

23
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:42,445
this vector I am going
我将会

24
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:44,840
to take these two numbers
取这两个数字

25
00:00:44,849 --> 00:00:47,682
and multiply them with
并把他们

26
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,463
the first row of the
与矩阵的第一行相乘

27
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:51,884
matrix and add up the corresponding numbers.
然后把对应相乘的结果加起来

28
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,223
Take one multiplied by
取1乘以1

29
00:00:54,223 --> 00:00:57,430
one, and take
同时取3

30
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,616
three and multiply it by
乘以

31
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:01,557
five, and that's

32
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,542
what, that's one plus fifteen so that gives me sixteen.
计算得到1和15 相加得16

33
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:06,879
I'm going to write sixteen here.
我将在这儿写上16

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,926
then for the second row,
要计算第二行

35
00:01:09,926 --> 00:01:12,555
second element, I am
的第二个元素

36
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,022
going to take the second row
我需要将第二行

37
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:15,255
and multiply it by this vector,
与这个向量相乘

38
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:17,762
so I have four
所以我得到

39
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,554
times one, plus zero
4乘以1

40
00:01:20,554 --> 00:01:21,894
times five, which is
加上0乘以5

41
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:25,625
equal to four, so you'll have four there.
结果等于4 因此在这里写上4

42
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:28,168
And finally for the last
对于最后一个元素

43
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:30,015
one I have two one times
我需要计算(2, 1) 乘以 (1, 5)

44
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:31,540
one five, so two
所以先计算2乘以1

45
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,791
by one, plus one
再加上

46
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:36,361
by 5, which is equal
1乘以5

47
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,422
to a 7, and
最后结果为7

48
00:01:39,422 --> 00:01:43,145
so I get a 7 over there.
所以我在这儿写上7

49
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,464
It turns out that the
事实证明

50
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:48,102
results of multiplying that's
3x2的矩阵

51
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:50,750
a 3x2 matrix by a
和一个2x1的矩阵

52
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,498
2x1 matrix is also
即一个二维向量

53
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:55,504
just a two-dimensional vector.
相乘的结果

54
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:57,034
The result of this is
我们得到的

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,975
going to be a 3x1
将是一个3x1

56
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,945
matrix, so that's why
的矩阵

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,737
three by one 3x1
这个3x1的矩阵

58
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,534
matrix, in other words
就是这么得来的

59
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,141
a 3x1 matrix is just a three dimensional vector.
也就是一个三维向量

60
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,359
So I realize that I
我想

61
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:16,072
did that pretty quickly, and you're
我可能计算时做得很快

62
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:17,078
probably not sure that you can
你们并不一定能够

63
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:18,530
repeat this process yourself, but
自己重复这个过程

64
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,196
let's look in more detail
下面让我们更加仔细的看一下

65
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,019
at what just happened and what
刚刚我做了些什么以及一个向量

66
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,618
this process of multiplying a matrix by a vector looks like.
和一个矩阵相乘的计算过程是怎样的

67
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:28,478
Here's the details of how to
下面详细介绍了如何

68
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:30,532
multiply a matrix by a vector.
计算一个矩阵与一个向量相乘

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,014
Let's say I have a matrix A
假设这是一个矩阵A

70
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:33,355
and want to multiply it by
我希望将它乘以

71
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,637
a vector x. The
一个向量x

72
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,220
result is going to be some
结果记为

73
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,569
vector y. So the
向量y 所以

74
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:41,334
matrix A is a m
矩阵A是一个

75
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,388
by n dimensional matrix, so
mxn维矩阵

76
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:45,062
m rows and n columns and
有m行和n列

77
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,570
we are going to multiply that by a
我们让它与一个

78
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,651
n by 1 matrix, in other words an n dimensional vector.
nx1的矩阵相乘 换言之 一个n维向量

79
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:51,203
It turns out this
明显地

80
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,694
"n" here has to match this "n" here.
这里的两个n是相等的

81
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:55,933
In other words, the number of
也就是说

82
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:58,560
columns in this matrix, so
这个矩阵的列数

83
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,821
it's the number of n columns.
有n列

84
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:03,457
The number of columns here has
必须要与

85
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:06,442
to match the number of rows here.
另一个相乘矩阵的行数相同

86
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:09,274
It has to match the dimension of this vector.
即必须匹配这个向量的维数。

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,645
And the result of this product
这样相乘的结果

88
00:03:10,645 --> 00:03:15,681
is going to be an n-dimensional
将会是一个n维

89
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:19,858
vector y.  Rows here.
向量y

90
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:23,009
"M" is going
“M”将与

91
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,972
to be equal to the number
矩阵A的行数

92
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,237
of rows in this matrix "A".
相同

93
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,082
So how do you actually compute this vector "Y"?
那么如何计算这个向量“Y”呢？

94
00:03:31,082 --> 00:03:32,110
Well it turns out to compute
事实上

95
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,280
this vector "Y", the process
计算“Y”的过程可以分解为

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,860
is to get "Y""I", multiply "A's"
计算“Y”“I”的值

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
"I'th" row with the
让“A”的第I行元素

98
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,218
elements of the vector "X"
分别乘以向量“X”中的元素

99
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:41,623
and add them up.
并且相加

100
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,464
So here's what I mean.
就是这样子

101
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,035
In order to get the
为了得到

102
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,847
first element of "Y",
“Y”的第一个元素

103
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:49,980
that first number--whatever that turns
无论是多少

104
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,424
out to be--we're gonna take
我们将会

105
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,012
the first row of the
把矩阵“A”的

106
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,486
matrix "A" and multiply
第一行元素

107
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,680
them one at a time
每次同一个向量“X”的元素

108
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,842
with the elements of this vector "X".
相乘

109
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:01,755
So I take this first number
我取第一个数

110
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,912
multiply it by this first number.
与第一个数相乘

111
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:07,331
Then take the second number multiply it by this second number.
然后取第二个数同第二个数相乘

112
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,264
Take this third number whatever
取第三个数

113
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:10,603
that is, multiply it the third number
与第三个数相乘

114
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:12,871
and so on until you get to the end.
直到全部乘完

115
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,578
And I'm gonna add up the
最后 将这些相乘的结果

116
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:16,289
results of these products and the
加起来

117
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,918
result of paying that out is going to give us this first element of "Y".
这样我们就得到了“Y”的第一个元素

118
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:21,690
Then when we want to get
然后我们

119
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,334
the second element of "Y", let's say this element.
来计算“Y”的第二个元素

120
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,735
The way we do that is we
接下来我们

121
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:28,688
take the second row of
取A的第二行

122
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:30,078
A and we repeat the whole thing.
然后重复整个过程

123
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:31,265
So we take the second row
现在 我们取A的第二行

124
00:04:31,265 --> 00:04:32,994
of A, and multiply it
将它

125
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:34,407
elements-wise, so the elements
与其他元素相乘

126
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:35,814
of X and add
也就是X的元素

127
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,460
up the results of the products
将结果相加

128
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,402
and that would give me the
这样我们就得到了

129
00:04:38,402 --> 00:04:40,107
second element of Y. And
Y的第二个元素

130
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,598
you keep going to get and we
依次计算下去

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,839
going to take the third row
我们取A得第三行

132
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,720
of A, multiply element Ys
把元素Ys与

133
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,558
with the vector x,
向量x相乘

134
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,682
sum up the results and then
将结果加起来

135
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:50,246
I get the third element and so
然后得到第三个元素

136
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,600
on, until I get down
以此类推

137
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,139
to the last row like so, okay?
直到最后一行

138
00:04:55,676 --> 00:04:57,930
So that's the procedure.
所以 上述就是具体步骤

139
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,685
Let's do one more example.
让我们再举一个例子

140
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:05,240
Here's the example:  So let's look at the dimensions.
在这个例子中 我们先看一下矩阵的维度

141
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,428
Here, this is a three
左边是一个

142
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:11,086
by four dimensional matrix.
3x4矩阵

143
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:13,280
This is a four-dimensional vector,
右边是一个四维向量

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,292
or a 4 x 1 matrix, and
也就是4x1矩阵

145
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:16,825
so the result of this, the
所以这样相乘的结果

146
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:18,210
result of this product is going
将是

147
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,881
to be a three-dimensional vector.
一个三维向量

148
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,169
Write, you know, the vector,
我们在写的时候要给这个向量

149
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,531
with room for three elements.
留三个元素的空间

150
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:30,256
Let's do the, let's carry out the products.
现在让我们一起来算一下

151
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,915
So for the first element, I'm
首先是第一个元素

152
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,068
going to take these four numbers
我将会取这四个数

153
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,272
and multiply them with the
并将它们与向量X相乘

154
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:38,873
vector X. So I have
所以我需要计算

155
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:42,227
1x1, plus 2x3,
1x1 加上2X3

156
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:47,301
plus 1x2, plus 5x1, which
加1X2 加5X1

157
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,994
is equal to - that's
等于

158
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,602
1+6, plus 2+6, which gives me 14.
1 +6 再加上2 +6 也就是14。

159
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,156
And then for the
然后计算

160
00:05:58,156 --> 00:05:59,754
second element, I'm going
第二个元素 我要

161
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,422
to take this row now and
取这一行

162
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:04,604
multiply it with this vector  (0x1)+3.
然后与向量 (0X1)+3相乘

163
00:06:04,604 --> 00:06:06,196
All right, so
我们将得到

164
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:12,764
0x1+  3x3 plus
0x1 + 3x3

165
00:06:12,764 --> 00:06:19,958
0x2 plus 4x1,
0X2 + 4X1

166
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,974
which is equal to, let's
等于

167
00:06:22,974 --> 00:06:26,105
see that's 9+4, which is 13.
9 +4 也就是13。

168
00:06:26,105 --> 00:06:28,093
And finally, for the last
最后

169
00:06:28,093 --> 00:06:29,455
element, I'm going to take
对最后一个元素

170
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,847
this last row, so I
我将取最后一行

171
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:33,978
have minus one times one.
所以我得到了-1x1

172
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,068
You have minus two, or really there's a plus next to a two I guess.
-2x3

173
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,656
Times three plus zero
加上0x2

174
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,441
times two plus zero times
加上0x1

175
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:44,047
one, and so that's
所以

176
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:45,496
going to be minus one minus
我们将得到-1和-6

177
00:06:45,496 --> 00:06:46,474
six, which is going to make
相加得

178
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:49,636
this seven, and so that's vector seven.

179
00:06:49,636 --> 00:06:50,136
Okay?
明白了？

180
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:51,097
So my final answer is this
所以我最后的答案是

181
00:06:51,097 --> 00:06:54,033
vector fourteen, just to
一个向量 其中的元素为 14

182
00:06:54,033 --> 00:06:56,117
write to that without the colors, fourteen,
我将不给这些字涂上颜色

183
00:06:56,117 --> 00:06:59,843
thirteen, negative seven.
13 -7

184
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,567
And as promised, the
如前面说的

185
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:07,775
result here is a three by one matrix.
计算结果是一个3X1的矩阵

186
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,147
So that's how you multiply a matrix and a vector.
上述就是矩阵和向量相乘的方法

187
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,309
I know that a lot just
我知道

188
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:13,710
happened on this slide, so
这张幻灯片上内容很多

189
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,662
if you're not quite sure where all
如果你在看的过程中

190
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,228
these numbers went, you know,
不是很确定这些数字怎么来的

191
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,260
feel free to pause the video
你可以随时暂停视频

192
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,345
you know, and so take a
慢慢地

193
00:07:18,345 --> 00:07:19,980
slow careful look at this
仔细琢磨

194
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,195
big calculation that we just
整个计算过程

195
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:22,318
did and try to make
尽量

196
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,755
sure that you understand the steps
确保自己理解了

197
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,144
of what just happened to get
得到14 13 11

198
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:29,570
us these numbers,fourteen, thirteen and eleven.
这些结果的每一个步骤

199
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,959
Finally, let me show you a neat trick.
最后 我将教你们一个小技巧。

200
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,939
Let's say we have
假设我

201
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,462
a set of four houses so 4
有四间房子

202
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:38,650
houses with 4 sizes like these.
这些房子有四种大小

203
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,908
And let's say I have a
我有一个

204
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:41,418
hypotheses for predicting what is
假设函数

205
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,885
the price of a house, and
用于预测房子的价格

206
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,861
let's say I want to compute,
我需要计算

207
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:49,347
you know, H of X for each of my 4 houses here.
四间房子的大小作为X值时 H的大小（即预测的房价）

208
00:07:49,347 --> 00:07:51,039
It turns out there's neat way
这里有一种简单的方法

209
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,979
of posing this, applying this
可以同时

210
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,780
hypothesis to all of my houses at the same time.
计算四间房子的预测价格

211
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,795
It turns out there's a neat
我可以将它简单地

212
00:07:57,795 --> 00:07:59,509
way to pose this as a
利用

213
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:01,798
Matrix Vector multiplication.
矩阵向量相乘的思想来计算

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,672
So, here's how I'm going to do it.
所以 对于这个问题我会这么计算

215
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:06,717
I am going to construct a matrix as follows.
首先我要构建一个

216
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:08,122
My matrix is going to be
如下所示的矩阵

217
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:11,892
1111 times, and I'm
元素是1111

218
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:15,495
going to write down the sizes
然后我把四个房子的大小

219
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,935
of my four houses here and
写在这儿

220
00:08:19,935 --> 00:08:21,249
I'm going to construct a vector
我还需要构造一个向量

221
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:23,354
as well, And my
我的向量

222
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:25,609
vector is going to this
它将是一个

223
00:08:25,609 --> 00:08:30,072
vector of two elements, that's
二维向量

224
00:08:30,072 --> 00:08:32,182
minus 40 and 0.25.
即 40 和 0.25

225
00:08:32,182 --> 00:08:34,607
That's these two co-efficients;
这是预测函数的两个系数

226
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:35,432
data 0 and data 1.
theta0 和 theta1

227
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,835
And what I am going
接下来

228
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:38,048
to do is to take matrix
我要做的就是

229
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,708
and that vector and multiply them
将我构造好的矩阵和向量相乘

230
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,465
together, that times is that multiplication symbol.
这是相乘符号

231
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:43,288
So what do I get?
我将得到??什么结果呢？

232
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:46,412
Well this is a
左边是一个

233
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,228
four by two matrix.
4X2 矩阵。

234
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:52,005
This is a two by one matrix.
右边是一个 2X1 矩阵

235
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:53,952
So the outcome is going
所以结果

236
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:55,355
to be a four by one
将是一个4X1向量

237
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:59,506
vector, all right.
对吧

238
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,860
So, let me,
所以 让我在幻灯片上写上

239
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,334
so this is
结果将是

240
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:06,188
going to be a 4 by
一个4X1的矩阵

241
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:06,957
1 matrix is the outcome or
输出结果也就是

242
00:09:06,957 --> 00:09:10,035
really a four diminsonal vector,
一个四维向量

243
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:11,562
so let me write it as
让我来把它写出来

244
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:15,991
one of my four elements in my four real numbers here.
用四个实数表示我的四个元素

245
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,202
Now it turns out and so
事实上

246
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:18,952
this first element of this
结果的第一个元素

247
00:09:18,952 --> 00:09:20,497
result, the way I
我的计算方式

248
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:21,505
am going to get that is, I
是

249
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:25,526
am going to take this and multiply it by the vector.
将这一行同我的向量相乘

250
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:29,381
And so this is going to
结果将是

251
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:33,053
be -40 x
-40x1

252
00:09:33,053 --> 00:09:37,645
1 + 4.25 x 2104.
+ 4.25×2104。

253
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:38,998
By the way, on
顺便说一下

254
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:40,915
the earlier slides I was
在先前的幻灯片中

255
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,257
writing 1 x -40 and
我写的是 1x-40

256
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,405
2104 x 0.25, but
+ 2104x0.25

257
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:46,570
the order doesn't matter, right?
但是顺序无关紧要 对吧？

258
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,637
-40 x 1 is the same as 1 x -40.
-40×1 和 1×-40是一样的

259
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:52,115
And this first element, of course,
这第一个元素

260
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:55,288
is "H" applied to 2104.
就是当x为2104时的H值

261
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:57,395
So it's really the
因此

262
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:59,969
predicted price of my first house.
这是我的第一个房子的预测价格

263
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:02,351
Well, how about the second element?
那么 第二个元素呢？

264
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,089
Hope you can see
你应该已经想到了

265
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,912
where I am going to get the second element.
我要怎么计算第二个元素了

266
00:10:07,912 --> 00:10:08,750
Right?
对吗？

267
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,052
I'm gonna take this and multiply it by my vector.
我要把这个乘以我的向量

268
00:10:11,052 --> 00:10:13,154
And so that's gonna be
所以就是

269
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,038
-40 x 1 + 0.25 x 1416.
-40×1 + 0.25×1416

270
00:10:15,038 --> 00:10:23,037
And so this is going be "H" of 1416.
这就是x为1416的“H”值。

271
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,110
Right?
理解了吗？

272
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,024
And so on for the
这是第三个

273
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:30,720
third and the fourth
和第四个

274
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,797
elements of this 4 x 1 vector.
后面就依次计算这个4X1矩阵的第三和第四个元素

275
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,142
And just there, right?
得出结果

276
00:10:37,142 --> 00:10:39,239
This thing here that I
这里

277
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,131
just drew the green box around,
我画了绿色边框的部分

278
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:42,752
that's a real number, OK?
是一个实数 对吧？

279
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,169
That's a single real number,
它是一个实数

280
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,673
and this thing here that
这里

281
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,812
I drew the magenta box around--the
我画了洋红色边框的部分

282
00:10:47,812 --> 00:10:49,826
purple, magenta color box
紫色 洋红色 边框

283
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,908
around--that's a real number, right?
是一个实数 对吧？

284
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,683
And so this thing on
所以右边

285
00:10:52,683 --> 00:10:54,104
the right--this thing on the
最右边

286
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,200
right overall, this is a
 就是一个

287
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,288
4 by 1 dimensional matrix, was a 4 dimensional vector.
4X1矩阵 是一个4维向量

288
00:10:59,288 --> 00:11:00,728
And, the neat thing about
这个例子的一个小技巧是

289
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,128
this is that when you're
当你

290
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,613
actually implementing this in software--so
在程序中实现这个过程的时候

291
00:11:04,613 --> 00:11:06,344
when you have four houses and
当你有四间房子

292
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,525
when you want to use your hypothesis
你想使用自己的预测函数

293
00:11:08,525 --> 00:11:12,308
to predict the prices, predict the price "Y" of all of these four houses.
来预测房子的价格

294
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:13,553
What this means is that, you
完成这些工作

295
00:11:13,553 --> 00:11:16,130
know, you can write this in one line of code.
你可以用一行代码搞定

296
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,878
When we talk about octave and
我们后面会谈到Octave

297
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,782
program languages later, you can
以及编程语言

298
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,120
actually, you'll actually write this in one line of code.
你可以只写一行代码就完成整个过程

299
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,879
You write prediction equals my,
你可以这样写

300
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:29,697
you know, data matrix times
prediction = data matrix * parameters

301
00:11:30,582 --> 00:11:33,888
parameters, right?
对吧

302
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,994
Where data matrix is
数据矩阵是这一部分

303
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,661
this thing here, and parameters
参数

304
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:40,447
is this thing here, and this
是这一部分

305
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:44,138
times is a matrix vector multiplication.
这就是一个矩阵向量乘法

306
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,834
And if you just do this then
如果你这么做了

307
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:47,579
this variable prediction - sorry
这个变量prediction

308
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:49,270
for my bad handwriting - then
抱歉 我的字写得很潦草

309
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,942
just implement this one
只需要实现

310
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,357
line of code assuming you have
这一行代码

311
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:55,328
an appropriate library to do matrix vector multiplication.
如果你有一个做矩阵向量相乘的函数库的话

312
00:11:55,328 --> 00:11:56,518
If you just do this,
如果你这样做的话

313
00:11:56,518 --> 00:11:58,965
then prediction becomes this
右侧的prediction变量就会形成

314
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,714
4 by 1 dimensional vector, on
一个4维向量

315
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:04,655
the right, that just gives you all the predicted prices.
给你所有的预测价格。

316
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:07,163
And your alternative to doing
另一种计算方式是

317
00:12:07,163 --> 00:12:09,286
this as a matrix vector multiplication
作为一种矩阵向量相乘的方式

318
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,241
would be to write eomething like

320
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,150
And you have say a thousand houses
