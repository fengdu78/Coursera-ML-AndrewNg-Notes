2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,680
I'd like to tell you about
我将向大家介绍

3
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:04,560
a problem called Anomaly Detection.
异常检测(Anomaly detection)问题

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,220
This is a reasonably commonly
这是机器学习算法

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,740
use you type machine learning.
的一个常见应用

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,990
And one of the interesting aspects
这种算法的一个有趣之处在于

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,250
is that it's mainly for
它虽然主要用于

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,860
unsupervised problem, that there's some
非监督学习问题

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,240
aspects of it that are
但从某些角度看

10
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,000
also very similar to sort of the supervised learning problem.
它又类似于一些监督学习问题

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,440
So, what is anomaly detection?
那么 什么是异常检测呢？

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,000
To explain it. Let me use
为了解释这个概念

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,780
the motivating example of: Imagine
让我举一个例子吧

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,040
that you're a manufacturer of
假想你是一个

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,370
aircraft engines, and let's
飞机引擎制造商

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,850
say that as your aircraft
当你生产的飞机引擎

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,330
engines roll off the assembly
从生产线上流出时

18
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,580
line, you're doing, you know, QA or
你需要进行

19
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,850
quality assurance testing, and as
QA (质量控制测试)

20
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,340
part of that testing you
而作为这个测试的一部分

21
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,140
measure features of your
你测量了飞机引擎的一些特征变量

22
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,900
aircraft engine, like maybe, you measure
比如 你可能测量了

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,820
the heat generated, things like
引擎运转时产生的热量

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,340
the vibrations and so on.
或者引擎的振动等等

25
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,570
I share some friends that worked
我有一些朋友

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,940
on this problem a long time
很早之前就开始进行这类工作

27
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,610
ago, and these were actually the
在实际工作中

28
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,960
sorts of features that they were
他们确实会从真实的飞机引擎

29
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,910
collecting off actual aircraft
采集这些特征变量

30
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,540
engines so you
这样一来

31
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,570
now have a data set of
你就有了一个数据集

32
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,000
X1 through Xm, if you have
从x(1)到x(m)

33
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,490
manufactured m aircraft engines,
如果你生产了m个引擎的话

34
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,740
and if you plot your data, maybe it looks like this.
也许你会将这些数据绘制成图表 看起来就是这个样子

35
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:08,640
So, each point here, each cross
这里的每个点 每个叉

36
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,580
here as one of your unlabeled examples.
都是你的无标签数据

37
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,220
So, the anomaly detection problem is the following.
这样 异常检测问题可以定义如下

38
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,770
Let's say that on, you
我们假设

39
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,970
know, the next day, you
后来有一天

40
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,390
have a new aircraft engine
你有一个新的飞机引擎

41
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,860
that rolls off the assembly line
从生产线上流出

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,890
and your new aircraft engine has
而你的新飞机引擎

43
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,440
some set of features x-test.
有特征变量x-test

44
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,680
What the anomaly detection problem is,
所谓的异常检测问题就是

45
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,070
we want to know if this
我们希望知道

46
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,310
aircraft engine is anomalous in
这个新的飞机引擎是否有某种异常

47
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,480
any way, in other words, we want
或者说

48
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,110
to know if, maybe, this engine
我们希望判断

49
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,290
should undergo further testing
这个引擎是否需要进一步测试

50
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,370
because, or if it looks
因为 如果它看起来

51
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,560
like an okay engine, and
像一个正常的引擎

52
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,700
so it's okay to just ship
那么我们可以直接将它运送到客户那里

53
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,260
it to a customer without further testing.
而不需要进一步的测试

54
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,670
So, if your new
比如说

55
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,330
aircraft engine looks like
如果你的新引擎

56
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,150
a point over there, well, you
对应的点落在这里

57
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,200
know, that looks a lot
那么 你可以认为

58
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,440
like the aircraft engines we've seen
它看起来像我们之前见过的引擎

59
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,860
before, and so maybe we'll say that it looks okay.
因此我们可以直接认为它是正常的

60
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,740
Whereas, if your new aircraft
然而 如果你的新飞机引擎

61
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,390
engine, if x-test, you know, were
如果x-test

62
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,430
a point that were out here,
对应的点在这外面

63
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:02,270
so that if X1 and
这里x1和

64
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,800
X2 are the features of this new example.
x2是这个新引擎对应的特征变量

65
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,530
If x-tests were all the
如果x-test在外面这么远的地方

66
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,930
way out there, then we would call that an anomaly.
那么我们可以认为这是一个异常

67
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,640
and maybe send that aircraft engine
也许我们需要在向客户发货之前

68
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,720
for further testing before we
进一步检测

69
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,130
ship it to a customer, since
这个引擎

70
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,340
it looks very different than
因为它和我们之前见过的

71
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,350
the rest of the aircraft engines we've seen before.
其他飞机引擎看起来不一样

72
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,560
More formally in the anomaly
如果更正式的定义

73
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,230
detection problem, we're give
异常检测问题

74
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,160
some data sets, x1 through
那么我们有一些数据

75
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,340
Xm of examples, and we
从x(1)到x(m)

76
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,720
usually assume that these end
我们通常假定这m个样本

77
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,250
examples are normal or
都是正常的

78
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,910
non-anomalous examples, and we
或者说都不是异常的

79
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,100
want an algorithm to tell us
然后我们需要一个算法来告诉我们

80
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,300
if some new example x-test is anomalous.
一个新的样本数据x-test是否是异常

81
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,080
The approach that we're going
我们要采取的方法是

82
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,670
to take is that given this training
给定训练集

83
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,300
set, given the unlabeled training
给定无标签的训练集

84
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,280
set, we're going to
我们将

85
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,920
build a model for p of
对数据建一个模型p(x)

86
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,060
x. In other words, we're
也就是说

87
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,320
going to build a model for the
我们将对

88
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,230
probability of x, where
x的分布概率建模

89
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,330
x are these features of, say, aircraft engines.
其中x是这些特征变量 例如飞机引擎

90
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,290
And so, having built a
因此 当我们

91
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,350
model of the probability of x
建立了x的概率模型之后

92
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,230
we're then going to say that
我们就会说

93
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,280
for the new aircraft engine, if
对于新的飞机引擎

94
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,670
p of x-test is less
也就是x-test 如果概率p

95
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,180
than some epsilon then
低于阈值ε

96
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,170
we flag this as an anomaly.
那么就将其标记为异常

97
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,260
So we see a new engine
因此当我们看到一个新的引擎

98
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,960
that, you know, has very low probability
在我们根据训练数据

99
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,900
under a model p of
得到的p(x)模型中

100
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,130
x that we estimate from the data,
概率非常低时

101
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,370
then we flag this anomaly, whereas
我们就将其标记为异常

102
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,880
if p of x-test is, say,
反之 如果x-test的概率p

103
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,110
greater than or equal to some small threshold.
大于给定的阈值ε

104
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,620
Then we say that, you know, okay, it looks okay.
我们就认为它是正常的

105
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,740
And so, given the training set,
因此 给定图中的

106
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,890
like that plotted here, if
这个训练集

107
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,940
you build a model, hopefully
如果你建立了一个模型

108
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,020
you will find that aircraft engines,
你将很可能发现飞机引擎

109
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,500
or hopefully the model p of
很可能发现模型p(x)

110
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,070
x will say that points that
将会认为

111
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,540
lie, you know, somewhere in the
在中心区域的这些点

112
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,550
middle, that's pretty high probability,
有很大的概率值

113
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,830
whereas points a little bit further out have lower probability.
而稍微远离中心区域的点概率会小一些

114
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,050
Points that are even further out
更远的地方的点

115
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,220
have somewhat lower probability, and the
它们的概率将更小

116
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,420
point that's way out here,
这外面的点

117
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,400
the point that's way
和这外面的点

118
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,100
out there, would be an anomaly.
将成为异常点

119
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,280
Whereas the point that's way in
而这边的点

120
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,460
there, right in the
正好在中心区域的点

121
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,720
middle, this would be
这些点将是正常的

122
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,080
okay because p of x
因为在中心区域

123
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,300
right in the middle of that
p(x)概率值

124
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,320
would be very high cause we've
会非常大

125
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,320
seen a lot of points in that region.
因为我们看到很多点都落在了这个区域

126
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,580
Here are some examples of applications of anomaly detection.
异常检测算法有如下应用案例

127
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,990
Perhaps the most common application of

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,820
have many users, and if
假设你有很多用户

131
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,360
each of your users take different

132
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,740
activities, you know maybe
都在从事不同的活动

133
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,560
on your website or in the
也许是在你的网站上

134
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,180
physical plant or something, you
也许是在一个实体工厂之类的地方

135
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:23,670
can compute features of the different users activities.
你可以对不同的用户活动计算特征变量

136
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,730
And what you can do is build
然后 你可以

137
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,240
a model to say, you know,
建立一个模型

138
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,960

139
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,730
users behaving different ways.
各种行为的可能性

140
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,280
What is the probability of a particular vector

141
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,590
of features of a
对应的特征向量

142
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,750
users behavior so you
出现的概率

143
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,360
know examples of features of
因此 你看到

144
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,480
a users activity may be on
某个用户在网站上行为

145
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,650
the website it'd be things like,
的特征变量是这样的

146
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,350
maybe x1 is how often does
也许x1是用户登陆的频率

147
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,460
this user log in, x2, you know, maybe
x2也许是

148
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,920
the number of what
用户访问

149
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,330
pages visited, or the
某个页面的次数

150
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,420
number of transactions, maybe x3
或者交易次数

151
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,820
is, you know, the number of
也许x3是

152
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,990
posts of the users on the
用户在论坛上发贴的次数

153
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,850
forum, feature x4 could

156
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,980
websites can actually track that
有些网站是可以记录

157
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,410
was the typing speed of this
用户每秒

158
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,010
user in characters per second.
打了多少个字母的

159
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,610
And so you can model p of x based on this sort of data.
因此你可以根据这些数据建一个模型p(x)

160
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,140
And finally having your model
