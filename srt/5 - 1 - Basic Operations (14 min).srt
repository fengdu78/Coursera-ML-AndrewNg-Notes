1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,346
You now know a bunch about machine learning.
你现在已经掌握不少机器学习知识了
(字幕整理：中国海洋大学 黄海广,haiguang2000@qq.com )

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,635
In this video, I like to
在这段视频中

3
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:05,448
teach you a programing language,
我将教你一种编程语言

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:06,718
Octave, in which you'll be
Octave语言

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,878
able to very quickly implement
你能够用它来非常迅速地

6
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,259
the the learning algorithms we've
实现这门课中我们已经学过

7
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:11,770
seen already, and the learning
或者将要学的

8
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,872
algorithms we'll see later in this course.
机器学习算法

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,381
In the past, I've tried to teach machine learning
过去我一直尝试用不同的编程语言

10
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:19,497
using a large variety of different programming languages
来教授机器学习

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,046
including C++ Java,
包括C++、Java、

12
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,379
Python, NumPy, and also
Python、Numpy

13
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:27,128
Octave, and what I
和 Octave

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,783
found was that students were able
我发现当使用像

15
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,535
to learn the most
Octave这样的

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,497
productively learn the most quickly
高级语言时

17
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:33,780
and prototype your algorithms most
学生能够更快

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,569
quickly using a relatively
更好地学习

19
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,262
high level language like octave.
并掌握这些算法

20
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,798
In fact, what I often
事实上 在硅谷

21
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:41,516
see in Silicon Valley is
我经常看到的情况是

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,655
that if even if you need to build.
进行大规模的

23
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:44,714
If you want to build a large
机器学习项目的人

24
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,548
scale deployment of a learning
通常会使用的

25
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,242
algorithm, what people will often do
程序语言

26
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:50,637
is prototype and the language is Octave.
就是Octave

27
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,200
Which is a great prototyping language.
Octave是一种很好的原始语言(prototyping language)

28
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,264
So you can sort of get your learning algorithms working quickly.
使用Octave 你能快速地实现你的算法

29
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,629
And then only if you need
剩下的事情 你只需要

30
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:58,459
to a very large scale deployment of it.
进行大规模的资源配置

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,362
Only then spend your time
你只用再花时间

32
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:03,059
re-implementing the algorithm
用C++或Java这些语言

33
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,150
to C++ Java or some of the language like that.
把算法重新实现就行了

34
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,273
Because all the lessons we've learned is
因为我们知道

35
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,679
that a time or develop a time.
开发项目的时间

36
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,848
That is your time.
或者说你的时间 是很宝贵的

37
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,309
The machine learning's time is incredibly valuable.
机器学习的时间也是很宝贵的

38
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,101
And if you can
所以 如果你能

39
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:17,898
get your learning algorithms to work more quickly in Octave.
让你的学习算法在Octave上快速的实现

40
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:18,932
Then overall you have a
基本的想法实现以后

41
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:20,697
huge time savings by first
再用C++或者Java去改写

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,143
developing the algorithms in
这样

43
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,971
Octave, and then implementing and
 你就能节省出

44
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:28,145
maybe C++ Java, only after we have the ideas working.
大量的时间

45
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,238
The most common prototyping language I
据我所见 人们使用最多的

46
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,538
see people use for machine
用于机器学习的原始语言

47
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,058
learning are: Octave, MATLAB,
是Octave、MATLAB

48
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:37,230
Python, NumPy, and R.
Python、NumPy 和 R

49
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,032
Octave is nice because open sourced.
Octave很好 因为它是开源的

50
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,660
And MATLAB works well
当然 MATLAB也很好

51
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,656
too, but it is expensive for
但它不是每个人都

52
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:45,956
to many people.
买得起的

53
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,972
But if you have access to a copy of MATLAB.
但是 如果你能够使用MATLAB

54
00:01:47,988 --> 00:01:50,095
You can also use MATLAB with this class.
你也可以在这门课里面使用

55
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,037
If you know Python, NumPy,
如果你会Python、NumPy

56
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:54,853
or if you know R. I do see some people use it.
或者R语言 我也见过有人用 R 的

57
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,353
But, what I see is
但是 据我所知

58
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,739
that people usually end up
这些人不得不中途放弃了

59
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,041
developing somewhat more slowly, and
因为这些语言在开发上比较慢

60
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,121
you know, these languages.
而且 因为这些语言

61
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:04,048
Because the Python, NumPy syntax
Python、NumPy的语法

62
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:08,391
is just slightly clunkier than the Octave syntax.
相较于Octave来说 还是更麻烦一点

63
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,704
And so because of that, and
正因为这样

64
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:11,372
because we are releasing starter
也因为我们最开始

65
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,039
code in Octave.
用Octave来写程序

66
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,363
I strongly recommend that you
所以我强烈建议你

67
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:18,321
not try to do the following exercises in this class in NumPy and R.
不要用NumPy或者R来完整这门课的作业

68
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,805
But that I do recommend that
我建议你

69
00:02:19,805 --> 00:02:21,498
you instead do the programming exercises
在这门课中

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,292
for this class in octave instead.
用Octave来写程序

71
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,428
What I'm going to do in
接下来

这些都放在网上了

84
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:50,226
Concretely, what I recommend
总之 我建议你

85
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:53,225
you do is first watch the tutorial videos.
先看教学视频

86
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,118
And after watching to the
之后

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,728
end, then install Octave on your computer.
把Octave安装到电脑上

88
00:02:58,728 --> 00:02:59,738
And finally, it goes to
最后 去这门课的网站上

89
00:02:59,738 --> 00:03:01,769
the course website, download the transcripts
下载这门课的

90
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,983
of the things you see in the
相关文档和视频

91
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,915
session, and type in
然后 你可以试着

92
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,162
whatever commands seem interesting
在Octave中键入一些

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,132
to you into Octave, so that it's
有趣的命令

94
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:10,602
running on your own computer, so
让程序运行在你的电脑上

95
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:12,962
you can see it run for yourself.
这样你可以看到程序是怎么运行的

96
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,535
And with that let's get started.
让我们开始吧

97
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,363
Here's my Windows desktop, and I'm going to start up Octave.
这里是我的Windows桌面 启动Octave

98
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,977
And I'm now in Octave.
现在打开Octave

99
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:22,522
And that's my Octave prompt.
这是Octave命令行

100
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,475
Let me first show the elementary
现在让我示范

101
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:27,291
operations you can do in Octave.
最基本的Octave代码

102
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,505
So you type in 5 + 6.
输入5 + 6

103
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:30,493
That gives you the answer of 11.
然后得到11

104
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:31,516
3 - 2.
输入3 - 2

105
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,710
5 x 8, 1/2, 2^6
5×8、1/2、2 ^ 6

106
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:37,747
is 64.
得到64

107
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,361
So those are the elementary math operations.
这些都是基本的数学运算

108
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,495
You can also do logical operations.
你也可以做逻辑运算

109
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,929
So one equals two.
例如 1==2

110
00:03:45,929 --> 00:03:47,722
This evaluates to false.
计算结果为 false  ( 假 )

111
00:03:47,722 --> 00:03:51,658
The percent command here means a comment.
这里的百分号命令表示注释

112
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:53,861
So, one equals two, evaluates to false.
1==2 计算结果为假

113
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,622
Which is represents by zero.
这里用0表示

114
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,028
One not equals to two.
1 ~= 2

115
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,312
This is true.
这是真的

116
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:00,718
So that returns one.
因此返回1

117
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:02,146
Note that a not equal sign
请注意 不等于符号的写法

118
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:05,478
is this tilde equals symbol.
是这个波浪线加上等于符号 ( ~= )

119
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,336
And not bang equals.
而不是等于感叹号加等号 ( != )

120
00:04:07,336 --> 00:04:09,267
Which is what some other
这是和其他一些

121
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,878
programming languages use.
编程语言中不太一样的地方

122
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,616
Lets see logical operations one and zero
让我们看看逻辑运算 1 && 0

123
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,545
use a double ampersand sign to
使用双＆符号

124
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:17,340
the logical AND.
表示逻辑与

125
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,188
And that evaluates false.
1 && 0判断为假

126
00:04:20,188 --> 00:04:23,886
One or zero is the OR operation.
1和0的或运算 1 || 0

127
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,736
And that evaluates to true.
其计算结果为真

128
00:04:25,736 --> 00:04:27,131
And I can XOR one and
还有异或运算 如XOR ( 1, 0 )

129
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:30,333
zero, and that evaluates to one.
其返回值为1

130
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,928
This thing over on the left, this Octave 324.x
从左向右写着 Octave 324.x版本

131
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:35,683
equals 11, this is the default Octave prompt.
其计算结果等于11 这是默认的Octave提示

132
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,513
It shows the, what, the
它显示了当前Octave的版本

133
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,150
version in Octave and so on.
以及相关的其它信息

134
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,423
If you don't want that prompt,
如果你不想看到那个提示

135
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,025
there's a somewhat cryptic command PF
这里有一个隐藏的命令

136
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,670
quote, greater than, greater
输入命令

137
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,602
than and so on,
PS('>>  ');

138
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:48,800
that you can use to change the prompt.
现在你看到的就是等待命令的快捷提示

139
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,272
And I guess this quote a string in the middle.
这句话在中间有一个字符串

140
00:04:51,272 --> 00:04:53,362
Your quote, greater than, greater than, space.
('>>  ');

141
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,592
That's what I prefer my Octave prompt to look like.
这是我喜欢的命令行样子

142
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:57,722
So if I hit enter.
这里敲一个回车

143
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,763
Oops, excuse me.
抱歉 写错了

144
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:00,786
Like so.
这样才对

145
00:05:00,786 --> 00:05:02,622
PS1 like so.
要写成PS1这样

146
00:05:02,622 --> 00:05:05,420
Now my Octave prompt has changed to the greater than, greater than sign.Which,
现在命令提示已经变得简化了

147
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,263
you know, looks quite a bit better.
这样看起来很棒

148
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,384
Next let's talk about Octave variables.
接下来 我们将谈到Octave的变量

149
00:05:12,384 --> 00:05:13,865
I can take the variable
现在写一个变量

150
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,165
A and assign it to 3.
对变量A赋值为3

151
00:05:16,165 --> 00:05:18,421
And hit enter.
并按下回车键

152
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,043
And now A is equal to 3.
显示变量A等于3

153
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,861
You want to assign a variable, but you don't want to print out the result.
如果你想分配一个变量 但不希望在屏幕上显示结果

154
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:26,758
If you put a semicolon, the semicolon
你可以在命令后加一个分号

155
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,824
suppresses the print output.
可以抑制打印输出

156
00:05:30,824 --> 00:05:33,160
So to do that, enter, it doesn't print anything.
敲入回车后 不打印任何东西。

157
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,399
Whereas A equals 3.
A等于3

158
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,719
mix it, print it out,
只是不显示出来

159
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,845
where A equals, 3 semicolon doesn't print anything.
其中这句命令不打印任何东西

160
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,845
I can do string assignment.
现在举一个字符串的例子

161
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:43,473
B equals hi
变量b等于"hi"

162
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,047
Now if I just
现在

163
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:46,072
enter B it prints out the
如果我输入b

164
00:05:46,072 --> 00:05:48,338
variable B. So B is the string hi
则会显示字符串变量b的值"hi"

165
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,118
C equals 3 greater than colon 1.
C等于3大于等于1

166
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,538
So, now C evaluates the true.
所以 现在C变量的值是真

167
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,999
If you want to print
如果你想打印出变量

168
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,832
out or display a variable, here's how you go about it.
或显示一个变量 你可以像下面这么做

169
00:06:00,832 --> 00:06:03,725
Let me set A equals Pi.
设置A等于圆周率π

170
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,985
And if I want to print
如果我要打印该值

171
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:08,545
A I can just type A like so, and it will print it out.
那么只需键入A 像这样 就打印出来了

172
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:10,344
For more complex printing there is
对于更复杂的屏幕输出

173
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:13,674
also the DISP command which stands for Display.
也可以用DISP命令显示

174
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,858
Display A just prints out A like so.
Disp( A )就相当于像这样打印出A

175
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,337
You can also display strings
你也可以用该命令来显示字符串

176
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:21,392
so: DISP, sprintf, two
输入disp sprintf

177
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,990
decimals, percent 0.2,
小数 0.2%

178
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,273
F, comma, A. Like so.
逗号 A 像这样

179
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:29,863
And this will print out the string.
通过这条命令将打印出字符串

180
00:06:29,863 --> 00:06:31,722
Two decimals, colon, 3.14.
打印显示为“两位小数：3.14”

181
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:33,651
This is kind of
这是一种

182
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,993
an old style C syntax.
旧风格的C语言语法

183
00:06:35,993 --> 00:06:37,404
For those of you that
对于之前

184
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,073
have programmed C before, this is
就学过C语言的同学来说

185
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:41,378
essentially the syntax you use to print screen.
你可以使用这种基本的语法来将结果打印到屏幕

186
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,498
So the Sprintf generates a
Sprintf命令生成一个字符串

187
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,021
string that is less
不仅仅是

188
00:06:46,021 --> 00:06:48,274
than the 2 decimals, 3.1 plus string.
字符串“2 decimal：3.14”

189
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,644
This percent 0.2 F means
其中的“0.2％F”表示

190
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,475
substitute A into here,
代替A放在这里

191
00:06:52,475 --> 00:06:55,926
showing the two digits after the decimal points.
并显示A值的小数点后两位数字

192
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:58,104
And DISP takes the string
同时DISP 命令对字符串做出操作

193
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,691
DISP generates it by the Sprintf command.
DISP命令输出

194
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:01,683
Sprintf.
Sprintf产生的字符串

195
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:03,091
The Sprintf command.
Sprintf命令

196
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:05,835
And DISP actually displays the string.
和DISP命令显示字符串

197
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,020
And to show you another
再说一个细节

198
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,360
example, Sprintf six decimals
例如 sprintf命令的六个小数

199
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,551
percent 0.6 F comma A.
0.6％F ,A

200
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,075
And, this should print Pi
这应该打印π

201
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,100
with six decimal places.
的6位小数形式

202
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,728
Finally, I was saying, a like so, looks like this. There
最后 看起来像这样

203
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,633
are useful shortcuts that type type formats long.
也有一些控制输出长短格式的快捷命令

204
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,759
It causes strings by default.
默认情况下 是字符串

205
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,748
Be displayed to a lot more decimal places.
显示出的小数位有点多

206
00:07:33,748 --> 00:07:35,593
And format short is a
短 ( short ) 格式

207
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:37,095
command that restores the default
是默认的输出格式

208
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,113
of just printing a small number of digits.
只是打印小数数位的第一位

209
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,934
Okay, that's how you work with variables.
相关这方面的内容还需要你继续练习

210
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:47,047
Now let's look at vectors and matrices.
下面 让我们来看看向量和矩阵

211
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,274
Let's say I want to assign MAT A to the matrix.
比方说 建立一个矩阵A

212
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,974
Let me show you an example: 1, 2,
输入1  2

213
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,593
semicolon, 3, 4, semicolon, 5, 6.
; 3 4  ;  5 6

214
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,235
This generates a three by
这会产生一个

215
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,572
two matrix A whose first
三行两列的矩阵A

216
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,818
row is 1, 2. Second row
其第一行是1 2

217
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,030
3, 4. Third row is 5, 6.
第二行是3 4 第三行是5 6

218
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,385
What the semicolon does is
分号的作用

219
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,818
essentially say, go to
从本质上来说

220
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,915
the next row of the matrix.
就是在矩阵内换行到下一行

221
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,016
There are other ways to type this in.
此外 还有其他的方法来建立矩阵A

222
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:11,536
Type A 1, 2 semicolon
输入A矩阵的值 1 2 分号

223
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:15,046
3, 4, semicolon, 5, 6, like so.
3 4 分号 5 6

224
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:17,038
And that's another equivalent way of
这是另一种方法

225
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,576
assigning A to be
对A矩阵进行赋值

226
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:22,183
the values of this three by two matrix.
考虑到这是一个三行两列的矩阵

227
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,568
Similarly you can assign vectors.
你同样可以用向量

228
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:25,532
So V equals 1, 2, 3.
建立向量V并赋值1 2 3

229
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,359
This is actually a row vector.
V是一个行向量

230
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,915
Or this is a 3 by 1 vector.
或者说是一个3 ( 列 )×1 ( 行 ) 的向量

231
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,016
Where that is a fat Y vector,
一个胖胖的Y向量

232
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,375
excuse me, not, this is
或者说

233
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,998
a 1 by 3 matrix, right.
一行三列的矩阵

234
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:39,256
Not 3   by 1.
注意不是三行一列

235
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:41,015
If I want to assign
如果我想

236
00:08:41,015 --> 00:08:43,975
this to a column vector,
分配一个列向量

237
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:48,778
what I would do instead is do v 1;2;3.
我可以写“1;2;3”

238
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,030
And this will give me a 3 by 1.
现在便有了一个

239
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,797
There's a 1 by 3 vector.
3 行 1 列 的向量

240
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:55,892
So this will be a column vector.
同时这是一个列向量

241
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,968
Here's some more useful notation.
下面是一些更为有用的符号

242
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:02,343
V equals 1: 0.1: 2.
V等于1：0.1：2

243
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:03,598
What this does is
这个该如何理解呢

244
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,716
it sets V to the bunch
这个集合V是一组值

245
00:09:05,716 --> 00:09:08,714
of elements that start from 1.
从数值1开始

246
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,392
And increments and steps
增量或说是步长为0.1

247
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,657
of 0.1 until you get up to 2.
直到增加到2

248
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:19,168
So if I do this, V is going to be this, you know, row vector.
按照这样的方法对向量V操作 可以得到一个行向量

249
00:09:19,168 --> 00:09:23,022
This is what one by eleven matrix really.
这是一个1行11列的矩阵

250
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:23,739
That's 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and
其矩阵的元素是1  1.1  1.2  1.3

251
00:09:23,739 --> 00:09:26,921
so on until we
依此类推

252
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,141
get up to two.
直到数值2

253
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,269
Now, and I can also
现在 我也可以

254
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,049
set V equals one colon six,
建立一个集合V并用命令“1:6”进行赋值

255
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:38,270
and that sets V to be these numbers.
这样V就被赋值了

256
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,291
1 through 6, okay.
1至6的六个整数

257
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,254
Now here are some other ways to generate matrices.
这里还有一些其他的方法来生成矩阵

258
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:47,426
Ones 2.3 is a command
例如“ones(2, 3)”

259
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,134
that generates a matrix that
也可以用来生成矩阵

260
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,790
is a two by three matrix
其结果为一个两行三列的矩阵

261
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,712
that is the matrix of all ones.
不过矩阵中的所有元素都为1

262
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:53,991
So if I set that c2
当我想生成一个

263
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,845
times ones two by
元素都为2

264
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:59,798
three this generates a
两行三列的矩阵

265
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:03,061
two by three matrix that is all two's.
就可以使用这个命令

266
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,258
You can think of this as a
你可以把这个方法当成一个

267
00:10:04,258 --> 00:10:05,513
shorter way of writing this and
生成矩阵的快速方法

268
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,943
c2,2,2's and you can
当你想生成一个三维2×2×2的矩阵时

269
00:10:06,943 --> 00:10:10,951
call them 2,2,2, which would also give you the same result.
你就可以用这个“ones”命令

270
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,910
Let's say W equals one's, one
比方说

271
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,485
by three, so this is
w是一个有三个1的

272
00:10:15,485 --> 00:10:17,937
going to be a row vector
行向量

273
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,998
or a row of
或者说一行

274
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:23,853
three one's and similarly
由三个同样的1组成的向量

275
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:25,463
you can also say w equals
你也可以说

276
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:27,469
zeroes, one by
w为一个

277
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:30,209
three, and this generates a matrix.
一行三列的零矩阵

278
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,732
A one by three matrix of all zeros.
一行三列的A矩阵里的元素全部是零

279
00:10:34,732 --> 00:10:36,910
Just a couple more ways to generate matrices .
还有很多的方式来生成矩阵

280
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,175
If I do W equals
如果我对W进行赋值

281
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,512
Rand one by three,
用Rand命令建立一个一行三列的矩阵

282
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,050
this gives me a one
因为使用了Rand命令

283
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,370
by three matrix of all random numbers.
则其一行三列的元素均为随机值

284
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:47,118
If I do Rand
如果我使用

285
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:49,008
three by three.
“rand(3, 3)”命令

286
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,417
This gives me a three by
这就生成了一个

287
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,918
three matrix of all
3×3的矩阵

288
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,009

uniform distribution between zero and one.
数值介于0和1之间

290
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,937
So every time I do
所以

291
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,608
this, I get a different
正是因为这一点

292
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:00,510
set of random numbers drawn
我们可以得到

293
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,573
uniformly between zero and one.
数值均匀介于0和1之间的元素

294
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:03,718

311
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,623
the end because I don't really want this printed out.
这样结果就打印不出来

312
00:11:35,623 --> 00:11:37,599
This is going to be a what?
那这样会得到什么呢

313
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,905
Well, it's going to
这样就可以

314
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,582
be a vector of, with
得到

315
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,481
a hundred thousand, excuse me, ten thousand elements.
一个有10000元素的向量

316
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,596
So, well, actually, you know what?
想知道具体是多少

317
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:48,373
Let's print it out.
我们也可把它打印出来

318
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,570
So this will generate a matrix like this.
这将产生一个这样的矩阵

319
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,408
Right?
看

320
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:53,978
With 10,000 elements.
这就是一个

321
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:55,835
So that's what W is.
有着10000个元素的矩阵W

322
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,392
And if I now
如果我现在

323
00:11:57,392 --> 00:11:59,442
plot a histogram of W
用绘制直方图命令

324
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:01,818
with a hist command, I can
绘制出一个直方图

325
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,752
now. And Octave's print hist
使用Octave的

326
00:12:04,752 --> 00:12:06,130
command, you know, takes a
打印直方图命令

327
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,297
couple seconds to bring this up,
你只需要数秒钟就可以将它绘制出来

328
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:08,965
but this is a histogram of
这是一个对随机变量W

329
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,646
my random variable for W.
绘制出的直方图

330
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,732
There was minus 6 plus zero
这里是-6+0

331
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,537
ten times this Gaussian random variable.
乘上十倍的高斯随机变量

332
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,537
And I can plot a histogram with
这样 可以绘制出一个

333
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,032
more buckets, with more bins, with say, 50 bins.
有着更多条的 乃至50个条的直方图来

334
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,578
And this is my
这样 就有一个

335
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:25,735
histogram of a Gaussian with mean minus 6.
均值减去6的高斯直方图

336
00:12:25,735 --> 00:12:27,285
Because I have a minus
因为这里是

337
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:29,208
6 there plus square root 10 times this.
-6加10的平方根并与这项相乘

338
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,952
So the variance of
因此

339
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,961
this Gaussian random variable
这个高斯随机变量的方差

340
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,696
is 10 on the standard deviation is

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,935
square root of 10, which is about what?
且其标准偏差为10的平方根

342
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,063
Three point one.
3.1

343
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,857
Finally, one special command
最后 说一个生成矩阵的

344
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:46,208
for generator matrix, which is the I command.
特殊命令I

345
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:48,394
So I stands for this
其实

346
00:12:48,394 --> 00:12:51,028
is maybe a pun on the word identity.
I也可说是一个双关语字标识

347
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,650
It's server set eye 4.
设置一个4阶单位矩阵

348
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,004
This is the 4 by 4 identity matrix.
这是一个4×4矩阵

349
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,681
So I equals eye 4.
所以I为“eye(4)”

350
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:00,458
This gives me a 4 by 4 identity matrix.
通过上面的命令得到4×4矩阵

351
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,475
And I equals eye 5,  eye 6.
I可以等于5阶单位阵 6阶单位阵

352
00:13:04,475 --> 00:13:05,611
That gives me a 6 by
那么就有

353
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:08,089
6 identity matrix, i3
6阶单位阵

354
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,134
is the 3 by 3 identity matrix.
eye( 3 )是一个3阶方阵

355
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:12,064
Lastly, to

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,479
Which is the help command.
那就是帮助命令

358
00:13:15,479 --> 00:13:17,454
So you can type help i and
例如 你可以键入help i

359
00:13:17,454 --> 00:13:21,181
this brings up the help function for the identity matrix.
它就会将矩阵的相关信息显示出来

360
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,803
Hit Q to quit.
命令Q可以退出Octave

361
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:25,375
And you can also type help rand.
你也可以键入help rand

362
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,793
Brings up documentation for the rand or the
将会显示出有关rand函数的相关帮助文档
