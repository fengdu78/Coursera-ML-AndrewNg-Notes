cosine function on top and
而不是替换了现有的图

73
00:02:28,499 --> 00:02:32,915
the r indicates the what is an event color.
r表示所使用的颜色

74
00:02:32,915 --> 00:02:35,166
And here additional commands - x

89
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,505
.png.
png是一个图像

90
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,292
So PNG is a graphics
文件格式

91
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:25,170
file format, and if you
如果你

92
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,612
do this it will let you save this as a file.
这样做了 它可以让你保存为一个文件

93
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:28,902
If I do that,
如果我这样做

94
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,287
let me actually change directory to,
让我先改一下路径

95
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,114
let's see, like
像这样

96
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,180
that, and then I will print that out.
然后我将它打出来

97
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,692
So this will take a
这需要一点时间

98
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,869
while depending on how
而这取决于你的

99
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,193
your Octave configuration is setup,
Octave的配置设置

100
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,891
may take a few seconds, but change

102
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,943
is now taking a few seconds to save this.
现在Octave需要几秒钟??的时间来保存它

103
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,635
If I now go to my desktop, Let's hide these windows.
如果我现在去到我的桌面  先最小化这些窗口

104
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,358
Here's myplot.png
这就是

105
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,720
which Octave has saved, and you
Octave所保存的myplot.png

106
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,481
know, there's the figure saved as the PNG file.
这就是保存为PNG的文件

107
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,530
Octave can save thousand other formats as well.
Octave也可以保存为很多其他的格式

108
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,468
So, you can type help plot,
你可以键入help  plot

109
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:09,497
if you want to see the
如果你想试试

110
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,512
other file formats, rather than
其他格式的文件  而不是

111
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,377
PNG, that you can save
PNG 你可以把图片

112
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,149
figures in.
保存为其他格式

113
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,471
And lastly, if you want
最后如??果你想

114
00:04:16,471 --> 00:04:18,507
to get rid of the plot, the
删掉这个图像

115
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,867
close command causes the figure to go away.
命令close会让这个图像关掉

116
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:24,963
As I figure if I type
如果我键入

117
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,628
close, that figure just
close  这个图像

118
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:30,153
disappeared from my desktop.
就从我的桌面消失了

119
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,372
Octave also lets you specify a figure and numbers.
Octave也可以让你为图像标号

120
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:36,935
You type figure 1 plots t, y1.
你键入figure(1); plot(t, y1);

121
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:39,582
That starts up
将显示

122
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,959
first figure, and that plots t, y1.
第一张图 绘制了变量t y1

123
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,075
And then if you want a second figure, you specify a different figure number.
如果你想绘制第二个图 你可以指定一个不同的数字编号

124
00:04:45,075 --> 00:04:47,765
So figure two, plot t,
键入figure(2); plot(t, y2);

125
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,924
y2 like so, and
正如这样

126
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:53,084
now on my desktop, I actually have 2 figures.
现在我的桌面上  其实有2个图

127
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,625
So, figure 1 and figure
图1和图2

128
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:55,874
2 thus 1 plotting the sine
此时一个绘制正弦

129
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:59,169
function, 1 plotting the cosine function.
函数  另一个绘制了余弦函数

130
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,498
Here's one other neat command that
这是另一个我经常使用的命令

131
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,825
I often use, which is the subplot command.
subplot命令

132
00:05:02,825 --> 00:05:05,401
So, we're going to use subplot 1 2 1.
我们要使用subplot(1,2,1)

133
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:07,958
What it does it sub-divides
它将图像

134
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:11,200
the plot into a
分为一个

135
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,760
one-by-two grid with the
1*2的格子

136
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,010
first 2 parameters are, and
也就是前两个参数

137
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,607
it starts to access the
然后它使用

138
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,335
first element. That's
第一个格子

139
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,714
what the final parameter 1 is, right?
也就是最后一个参数1的意思

140
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,568
So, divide my figure into a
所以，将我的图像分成

141
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:24,913
one by two grid, and I
1*2的格子

142
00:05:24,913 --> 00:05:26,585
want to access the first
我现在使用

143
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:27,948
element right now.
第一个格子

144
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,435
And so, if I type that
如果我键入这个

145
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:32,722
in, this product, this figure, is on the left.
那么这个图像显示在左边

146
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,291
And if I plot t,
如果键入plot(t, y1)

147
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,682
y1, it now fills
现在这个图

148
00:05:37,682 --> 00:05:40,462
up this first element.
显示在第一个格子

149
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,565
And if I I'll do subplot 122.
如果我键入subplot(1,2,2)

150
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:44,456
I'm going to start to
那么我就要

151
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:48,724
access the second element and plot t, y2.
使用第二个格子  键入plot(t, y2);

152
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,323
Well, throw in y2 in
现在y2显示在右边

153
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:54,875
the right hand side, or in the second element.
也就是第二个格子

154
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,114
And last command, you can
最后一个命令  你可以

155
00:05:56,114 --> 00:05:58,165
also change the axis scales
改变轴的刻度

156
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,308
and change axis these to 1.51
比如改成

157
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,892
minus 1 1 and this
[0.5 1 -1 1]

158
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:05,071
sets the x range
也就是设置了

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,195
Here's how you actually do this.
这里是你如何真正做到这一点

233
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,638
If I type A equals
如果我键入a=1

234
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,613

241
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:58,417
And this is a lot like
这很像

242

A equals 1, B equals
a=1; b=2;

243
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:01,755
2, C equals 3, except
c=3;

244
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:03,532
that if I use semicolons instead
