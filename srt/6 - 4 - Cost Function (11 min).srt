And as usual each of
像以前一样

12
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,130
our examples is represented by
我们的每个样本

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,830

17
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:39,951
feature is always equal to 1,
或者说第0个特征变量 一直是1

18
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,203

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,482
we choose, or how do we fit the parameters theta?
或者说如何拟合参数θ

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,125
Back when we were developing the
以前我们推导线性回归时

30
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:08,463
linear regression model, we use the following cost function.
使用了这个代价函数

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,868
I've written this slightly differently, where
我把这个写成稍微有点儿不同的形式

32
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,663
instead of 1/2m, I've
不写原先的1/2m

33
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,440
taken the 1/2 and put it inside the summation instead.
我把1/2放到求和符号里面了

34
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
Now, I want to use
现在我想用

35
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,132
an alternative way of writing
另一种方法

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,663
out this cost function which is
来写代价函数

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,009
that instead of writing out
去掉这个平方项

38
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,920
this squared and return here,
把这里写成

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,100
let's write here, cost of
这样的形式

40
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,476
H of X comma
（具体公式请看屏幕）

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,605
Y, and I'm going
（具体公式请看屏幕）

42
00:01:33,605 --> 00:01:37,176
to define that term cost
定义这个代价函数Cost函数

43
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,727
of H of X comma Y to be equal to this.
等于这个

44
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,641
It's just equal to just one half of the square root error.
等于这个1/2的平方根误差

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,800
So now, we can see more
因此现在

46
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,018
clearly that the cost
我们能更清楚的看到

47
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,145
function is a sum
代价函数是这个Cost函数

48
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:49,740
over my training set, or
在训练集范围上的求和

49
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,427
is 1/m times the sum
或者说是1/m倍的

50
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:56,046
over my training set of this cost term here.
这个代价项在训练集范围上的求和

51
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,065
And to simplify this
然后稍微简化一下这个式子

52
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,470
equation a little bit more, it's gonna
去掉这些上标

53
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,587
be convenient to get rid of those superscripts.
会显得方便一些

54
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,408
So just define cost of
所以直接定义

55
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:05,527
H of X comma Y to
代价值(h(X), Y)

56
00:02:05,527 --> 00:02:06,618
be equal to 1/2 of
等于1/2倍的

57
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:08,925
this square root error  and the
这个平方根误差

58
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:10,336
interpretation of this cost function
对这个代价项的理解是这样的

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,876
is that this is the
这是我所期望的

60
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,447
cost I want my learning
我的学习算法

61
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,110
algorithm to, you know,
如果想要达到这个值

62
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,701
have to pay, if it
也就是这个假设h(x)

63
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,737
outputs that value it
所需要付出的代价

64
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:19,912
this prediction is H of
这个希望的预测值是h(x)

65
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:21,258
X, and the actual
而实际值则是y

66
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,035
label was Y. So just
干脆

67
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,836
cross off those superscripts. All right.
全部去掉那些上标好了

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,756
And no surprise for linear
显然 在线性回归中

69
00:02:29,756 --> 00:02:31,537
regression the cost for you to define is that.
代价值会被定义为这个

70
00:02:31,537 --> 00:02:32,757
Well the cost for this
这个代价值是

71
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:34,535
is, that is 1/2
1/2乘以

72
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,232
times the square difference
预测值h和

73
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:37,663
between what are predicted and the
实际值观测的结果y

74
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,943
actual value that we observe
的差的平方

75
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,103
for Y. Now, this cost
这个代价值可以

76
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:42,848
function worked fine for linear
很好地用在线性回归里

77
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:47,418
regression, but here we're interested in logistic regression.
但是我们现在要用在逻辑回归里

78
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,146
If we could minimize this cost
如果我们可以最小化

79
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,992
function that is plugged into J here.
代价函数J里面的这个代价值

80
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,817
That will work okay.
它会工作得很好

81
00:02:53,817 --> 00:02:55,476
But it turns out that if
但实际上

82
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,640
we use this particular cost function
如果我们使用这个代价值

83
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,807
this would be a non-convex function of the parameters theta.
它会变成参数θ的非凸函数

84
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,968
Here's what I mean by non-convex.
我说的非凸函数是这个意思

85
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,313
We have some cost function J
对于这样一个代价函数J(θ)

86
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:08,118
of theta, and for logistic
对于逻辑回归来说

87
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,113
regression this function H here
这里的h函数

88
00:03:12,113 --> 00:03:13,495
has a non linearity, right?
是非线性的 对吧？

89
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,538
It says, you know, 1 over
它是等于 1 除以

90
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:16,384
1 plus E to the negative theta transfers
1+e的-θ转置乘以X次方

91
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:19,591
X. So it's a pretty complicated nonlinear function.
所以它是一个很复杂的非线性函数

92
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:21,108
And if you take the sigmoid
如果对它取Sigmoid函数

93
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,104
function and plug it in
然后把它放到这里

94
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:23,239
here and then take
然后求它的代价值

95
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,016
this cost function and plug
再把它放到这里

96
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,746
it in there, and then plot
然后再画出

97
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:28,200
what J of theta looks
J(θ)长什么模样

98
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,650
like, you find that
你会发现

99
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,493
J of theta can look like a function just like this.
J(θ)可能是一个这样的函数

100
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,958
You know with many local optima and
有很多局部最优值

101
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,321
the formal term for this
称呼它的正式术语是

102
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,488
is that this a non convex function.
这是一个非凸函数

103
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,644
And you can kind of tell.
你大概可以发现

104
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:41,880
If you were to run gradient
如果你把梯度下降法

105
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,192
descent on this sort of
用在一个这样的函数上

106
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,160
function, it is not guaranteed
不能保证它会

107
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,747
to converge to the global minimum.
收敛到全局最小值

108
00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:48,867
Whereas in contrast, what
相应地

109
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,350
we would like is to have
我们希望

110
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,100
a cost function J of theta
我们的代价函数J(θ)

111
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,599
that is convex, that is
是一个凸函数

112
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,250
a single bow-shaped function that
是一个单弓形函数

113
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,675
looks like this, so that
大概是这样

114
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,543
if you run gradient descent, we
所以如果对它使用梯度下降法

115
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:01,147
would be guaranteed that gradient descent, you know,
我们可以保证梯度下降法

116
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,917
would converge to the global minimum.
会收敛到该函数的全局最小值

117
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,020
And the problem of using the
但使用这个

118
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,460
the square cost function is that
平方代价函数的问题是

119
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,400
because of this very
因为中间的这个

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,371
non linear sigmoid function that
非常非线性的

121
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,107
appears in the middle here, J of
sigmoid函数的出现

122
00:04:14,107 --> 00:04:15,987
theta ends up being
导致J(θ)成为

123
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:17,962
a non convex function if you
一个非凸函数

124
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:21,294
were to define it as the square cost function.
如果你要用平方函数定义它的话

125
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,313
So what we'd would like to do
所以我们想做的是

126
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,822
is to instead come up with
另外找一个

127
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,576
a different cost function that
不同的代价函数

128
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:28,063
is convex and so
它是凸函数

129
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,257
that we can apply a great
使得我们可以使用很好的算法

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,919
algorithm like gradient descent
如梯度下降法

131
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,683
and be guaranteed to find a global minimum.
而且能保证找到全局最小值

132
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:37,295
Here's a cost function that we're going to use for logistic regression.
这个代价函数便是我们要用在逻辑回归上的

133
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,313
We're going to say the cost
我们认为

134
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,710
or the penalty that the algorithm
这个算法要付的代价或者惩罚

135
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,924
pays if it outputs
如果输出值是h(x)

136
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,596
a value H of X.
或者换句话说

137
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,722
So, this is some number like 0.7
假如说预测值h(x)

138
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:48,670
where it predicts a value H
是一个数 比如0.7

139
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,780
of X. And the actual
而实际上

140
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,032
cost label turns out to
真实的标签值是y

141
00:04:52,032 --> 00:04:54,087
be Y. The cost is
那么代价值将等于

142
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,061
going to be minus log
-log(h(X))

143
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,861
H of X if Y is equal 1.
当y=1时

144
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:59,447
And minus log, 1 minus
以及-log(1-h(X))

145
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,010
H of X if Y is equal to 0.
当y=0时

146
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,205
This looks like a pretty complicated function.
这看起来是个非常复杂的函数

147
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,773
But let's plot function to
但是让我们画出这个函数

148
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:08,147
gain some intuition about what it's doing.
可以直观地感受一下它在做什么

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,054
Let's start up with the case of Y equals 1.
我们从y=1这个情况开始

150
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,461
If Y is equal equal
如果y等于1

151
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:14,958
to 1, then the cost function
那么这个代价函数

152
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:18,240
is -log H of X, and
是-log(h(X))

153
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,601
if we plot that, so let's
如果我们画出它

154
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,564
say that the horizontal
我们将h(X)

155
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,961
axis is H of X.
画在横坐标上

156
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:24,722
So we know that a hypothesis
我们知道假设函数

157
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,611
is going to output a value between
的输出值

158
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,465
0 and 1.
是在0和1之间的

159
00:05:28,465 --> 00:05:28,465
Right?
对吧？

160
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,514
So H of X that varies
所以h(X)的值

161
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,940
between 0 and 1.
在0和1之间变化

162
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,469
If you plot what this cost function looks like.
如果你画出这个代价函数的样子

163
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,981
You find that it looks like this.
你会发现它看起来是这样的

164
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,044
One way to see why the
理解这个函数为什么是这样的

165
00:05:39,044 --> 00:05:41,363
plot like this it is because
一个方式是

166
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,988
if you were to plot log Z
如果你画出log(z)

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,656
with Z on the horizontal axis.
z在横轴上

168
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:48,794
Then that looks like that.
它看起来会是这样

169
00:05:48,794 --> 00:05:50,369
And it's approach is minus infinity.
它趋于负无穷

170
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,700
So this is what the log function looks like.
这是对数函数的样子

171
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,963
And so this is 0, this is 1.
所以这里是0 这里是1

172
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,560
Here Z is of
显然 这里的Z

173
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,653
course playing the role  of
就是代表h(x)的角色

174
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:02,030
H of X.  And so
因此

175
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,329
minus log Z will look like this.
-log(Z)看起来这样

176
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,098
Right just flipping the sign.
就是翻转一下符号

177
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,822
Minus log Z. And we're
-log(Z)

178
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:11,013
interested only in the
我们所感兴趣的是

179
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,580
range of when this function
函数在0到1

180
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,014
goes between 0 and 1.
之间的这个区间

181
00:06:14,014 --> 00:06:15,924
So, get rid of that.
所以 忽略那些

182
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:17,962
And so, we're just left with,
所以只剩下

183
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,555
you know, this part of the curve.
曲线的这部分

184
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,200
And that's what this curve on the left looks like.
这就是左边这条曲线的样子

185
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,472
Now this cost function
现在这个代价函数

186
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,666
has a few interesting and desirable properties.
有一些有趣而且很好的性质

187
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,103
First you notice that if
首先 你注意到

188
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:35,003
Y is equal to 1 and H of X is equal 1, in
如果y=1而且h(X)=1

189
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,367
other words, if the hypothesis
也就是说

190
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,000
exactly, you know, predicts
如果假设函数

191
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,261
H equals 1, and Y
刚好预测值是1

192
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:42,744
is exactly equal to what I predicted.
而且y刚好等于我预测的

193
00:06:42,744 --> 00:06:44,432
Then the cost is equal 0.
那么这个代价值等于0

194
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:44,432
Right?
对吧？

195
00:06:44,432 --> 00:06:47,475
That corresponds to, the curve doesn't actually flatten out.
这对应于… 这个曲线并不是平的

196
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,866
The curve is still going. First, notice
曲线还在继续走

197
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,006
that if H of X
首先 注意到如果h(x)=1

198
00:06:51,006 --> 00:06:53,056
equals 1, if the hypothesis
如果假设函数

199
00:06:53,056 --> 00:06:55,113
predicts that Y is equal to 1.
预测Y=1

200
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,342
And if indeed Y is
并且如果y确实等于1

201
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:58,502
equal to 1 then the cost is equal to 0.
那么代价值等于0

202
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,975
That corresponds to this point down here.
这对应于下面这个点

203
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:00,975
Right?
对吧？

204
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,332
If H of X is equal
如果h(X)=1

205
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:04,068
to 1, and we're only
这里我们只需要考虑

206
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,273
concerned the case that Y equals 1 here.
y=1的情况

207
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,366
But if H of X is equal to 1.
如果h(x)等于1

208
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,063
Then the cost is down here is equal to 0.
那么代价值等于0

209
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,082
And that is what we like it to be.
这是我们所希望的

210
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:13,968
Because, you know, if we
因为如果我们

211
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,673
correctly predict the output Y then the cost is 0.
正确预测了输出值y 那么代价值是0

212
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:21,466
But now, notice also
但是现在 同样注意到

213
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,456
that H of X approaches 0.
h(x)趋于0时

214
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,037
So, that's H. As the
所以 那是h

215
00:07:25,037 --> 00:07:26,909
output of the hypothesis approaches 0
当假设函数的输出趋于0时

216
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:30,163
the cost blows up, and it goes to infinity.
代价值激增 并且趋于无穷

217
00:07:30,163 --> 00:07:31,513
And what this does is
我们这样描述

218
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:34,271
it captures the intuition that if
体现出了这样一种直观的感觉

219
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,890
a hypothesis, you know, outputs 0.
那就是如果假设函数输出0

220
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,574
That's like saying, our hypothesis is
相当于说

221
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:39,960
saying, the chance of Y
我们的假设函数说

222
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,541
equals 1 is equal to 0.
Y=1的概率等于0

223
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,516
It's kind of like our going
这类似于

224
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,010
to our medical patient and saying,
我们对病人说

225
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,594
"The probability that you
你有一个恶性肿瘤的概率

226
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,337
have a malignant tumor, the
也就是说

227
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:49,807
probability that Y equals 1 is zero."
y=1的概率是0

228
00:07:49,807 --> 00:07:52,154
So, it's like absolutely impossible that your
就是说你的肿瘤

229
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,130
tumor is malignant.
完全不可能是恶性的

230
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,776
But if it turns out that
然而结果是

231
00:07:56,776 --> 00:08:00,111
the tumor, the patient's tumor, actually is malignant.
病人的肿瘤确实是恶性的

232
00:08:00,111 --> 00:08:01,879
So if Y is equal to
所以如果y=1

233
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,291
1 even after we told them
即使我们告诉他们

234
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,375
you know, the probability of it happening is 0.
它发生的概率是0

235
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,716
It's absolutely impossible for it to be malignant.
它完全不可能是恶性的

236
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:09,759
But if we told them
如果我们告诉他们这个

237
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,186
this with that level of certainty,
和我们的确信程度

238
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,018
and we turn out to be wrong,
并且最后我们是错的

239
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:14,688
then we penalize the learning algorithm
那么我们用非常非常大的代价值

240
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,122
by a very, very large cost,
惩罚这个学习算法

241
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:17,963
and that's captured by having this
它是被这样体现出来

242
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,474
cost goes infinity if Y
这个代价值趋于无穷

243
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:21,900
equals 1 and H
如果y=1

244
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,334
of X approaches 0.
而h(x)趋于0

245
00:08:24,334 --> 00:08:26,725
This might consider of
这是y=1时的情况

246
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,875
Y1, let's look at what
我们再来看看

247
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,371
the cost function looks like for Y0.
y=0时 代价值函数是什么样

248
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,710
If Y is equal to 0, then the cost
如果y=0

249
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,121
looks like this expression over here.
那么代价值是这个表达式

250
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,403
And if you plot
如果画出函数

251
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:42,751
the function minus log 1
-log(1-z)

252
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,839
minus Z what you
那么你得到的

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,245
get is the cost function actually looks like this.
代价函数实际上是这样

254
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,256
So, it goes from 0 to 1.
它从0到1

255
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,263
Something like that.
差不多这样

256
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,611
And so if you plot
如果你画出

257
00:08:54,611 --> 00:08:55,872
the cost function for the case
y=0情况下的

258
00:08:55,872 --> 00:08:57,823
of y equals zero, you find that it looks
代价函数

259
00:08:57,823 --> 00:09:00,763
like this and what
你会发现大概是这样

260
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:02,404
this curve does is it
它现在所做的是

261
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,937
now blows up,
在h(X)趋于1时激增

262
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:08,273
and it goes to plus infinity as H of X goes to 1.
趋于正无穷

263
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,880
Because it's saying that
因为它是说

264
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,199
if Y turns out to be
如果最后发现

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,168
equal to 0, but we
y等于0

266
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:13,966
predicted that you know, Y is
而我们却几乎

267
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:15,286
equal to 1 with almost
非常肯定地预测

268
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,281
certainty with probability 1, then
y=1的概率是1

269
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:21,569
we end up paying a very large cost.
那么我们最后就要付出非常大的代价值

270
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,143
Let's plot the cost function for
（以下这一段和前面重复了）让我们画出y=0时的

271
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:25,063
the case of Y equals 0.
代价函数

272
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:29,702
So if Y equals 0 that's going to be our cost function.
所以如果y=0 这就是我们的代价值函数

273
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,914
If you look at this expression,
如果你看着这个表达式

274
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:33,726
and if you plot, you know, minus
然后你画出

275
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:36,221
log 1 minus Z, if
-log(1-Z)

276
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:37,428
you figure out what that looks like,
如果你清楚它是什么样的

277
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:40,071
you get a figure that looks like this.
你会得到这样一个图形

278
00:09:40,071 --> 00:09:41,669
Where, which goes from 0
这样随着

279
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,610
to 1 with the Z
横轴上的z

280
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,850
axis on the horizontal axis.
从0到1

281
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,221
So If you take this cost
如果你画出

282
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:48,397
function and plot it for
y=0时的

283
00:09:48,397 --> 00:09:49,614
the case of Y equals 0,
代价函数

284
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:51,186
what you get is
你会发现

285
00:09:51,186 --> 00:09:55,109
that the cost function looks like this.
代价函数是这样的

286
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:56,743
And what this cost function
它所做的是

287
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,650
does is that it blows
代价函数会在这里激增

288
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,530
up or it goes to a
趋于正无穷

289
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,448
positive infinity as each
随着h(X)的增大

290
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,707
H of X goes to one
而趋近于1

291
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,443
and this captures the
这体现了这样一个直观的感觉

292
00:10:05,443 --> 00:10:07,159
intuition that if a hypothesis
如果假设函数预测

293
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,847
predicted that, you know, H of
h(X)=1

294
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,406
X is equal to 1 with
并且非常确定

295
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:12,121
certainty, with like probability 1,
比如这样的概率是1

296
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:14,283
it's absolutely got to be Y equals 1.
认为y肯定是1

297
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:15,563
But if Y turned out to
但是最后发现

298
00:10:15,563 --> 00:10:17,219
be equal to 0 then
y其实等于0

299
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:18,206
it makes sense to make the
这就必须要让假设函数

300
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:21,940
hypothesis, or make the learning algorithm pay a very large cost.
或者学习算法付出一个很大的代价

301
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,609
And conversely, if H
反过来

302
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,942
of X is equal to
如果h(x)=0

303
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,483
0 and Y equals zero,
而且y=0

304
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,983
then the hypothesis nailed it.
那么假设函数预测对了

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,626
The predicted Y is equal
预测的是y=0

306
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,371
to zero and it turns
并且y就是等于0

307
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:34,376
out Y is equal to zero
并且Y就是等于0

308
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,701
so at this point the cost
那么代价值函数在这点上

309
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,139
function is going to be 0.
应该等于0

310
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,163
In this video, we
在这个视频中

311
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,886
have defined the cost function
我们定义了

312
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:46,428
for a single training example.
单训练样本的代价函数

313
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:50,251
The topic of convexity analysis is beyond the scope of this course.
凸性分析的内容是超出这门课的范围的

314
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,594
But it is possible to show
但是可以证明

315
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,080
that with our particular choice
我们所选的

316
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,774
of cost function this would
代价值函数

317
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:57,926
give us a convex optimization problem
会给我们一个
