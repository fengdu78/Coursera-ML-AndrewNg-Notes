00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,950
of K-means clustering which is
K均值方法聚类中

capsule K. To be
说实话

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,690
honest, there actually isn't a
其实上没有一个

9
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,420
great way of answering this
非常好的方法回答这个问题

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,150
or doing this automatically and
或者能够自动做这件事情

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,930
by far the most common way
到目前为止 用来决定聚类

12
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,380
of choosing the number of clusters,
数目最常用的方法

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,040
is still choosing it manually
任然是通过

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,380
by looking at visualizations or by
看可视化的图或者通过

15
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,070
looking at the output of the clustering algorithm or something else.
查看聚类算法的输出结果或者其他一些东西来手动地决定聚类的类别数量

16
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,270
But I do get asked
但是 我也确实经常被问及

17
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,460
this question quite a lot of
这样的问题

18
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,510
how do you choose the number of
你是如何来选择聚类的数量的

19
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,930
clusters, and so I just want
我只是想

20
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,650
to tell you know what
告诉你

21
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,020
are peoples' current thinking on
现在人们所思考的

22
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,480
it although, the most
最为常见的

23
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,060
common thing is actually to
一件事实际上是

24
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,130
choose the number of clusters by hand.
手动去选择聚类的数目

25
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,680
A large part of
其中一大部分

26
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,020
why it might not always
为什么选择聚类

27
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,530
be easy to choose the
数量并不容易

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,940
number of clusters is that
的原因是

29
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,920
it is often generally ambiguous how many clusters there are in the data.
通常在数据集中有多少个聚类是不清楚的

30
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:53,890
Looking at this data set
看这样一个数据集

31
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,110
some of you may see
有些人可能会看到

32
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,830
four clusters and that
四个聚类

33
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,440
would suggest using K equals 4.
那么这就意味着需要使用K=4

34
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,650
Or some of you may
或者有些人可能

35
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,620
see two clusters and
会看到两个聚类

36
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,460
that will suggest K equals
这个条件下就意味着K等于

37
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,630
2 and now this may see three clusters.
2 现在这有可能是3个聚类

38
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,710
And so, looking at the
那么

39
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,750
data set like this, the
相类似于这样的数据集

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,390
true number of clusters, it actually
其真实的类别数对我来说实际上

41
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,560
seems genuinely ambiguous to me,
相当地模棱两可的

42
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,160
and I don't think there is one right answer.
我并不认为只有一个正确的答案

43
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,500
And this is part of our supervised learning.
这就是我们监督学习的一部分

44
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,450
We are aren't given labels, and
我们不知道分类

45
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,950
so there isn't always a clear cut answer.
因此总是没有一个清晰的答案

46
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,730
And this is one of the
这是其中的一个

47
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:26,710
things that makes it more difficult
使得（决定聚类数目）

48
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,530
to say, have an automatic
拥有一个自动化

49
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,860
algorithm for choosing how many clusters to have.
算法来决定聚类数目变得困难的原因

50
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,250
When people talk about ways of
当人们在讨论

51
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,270
choosing the number of clusters,
选择聚类数目的方法时

52
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,050
one method that people sometimes
有一个可能会

53
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,150
talk about is something called the Elbow Method.
谈及的方法叫作“肘部法则”

54
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,490
Let me just tell you a little bit about that,
让我告诉你一些关于这个法则的内容

55
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,760
and then mention some of its advantages but also shortcomings.
之后会提及到它的一些优点和缺点

56
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,980
So the Elbow Method,
关于“肘部法则”

57
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,570
what we're going to do is vary
我们所需要做的是改变

58
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,860
K, which is the total number of clusters.
K值 也就是聚类类别数目的总数

59
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,570
So, we're going to run K-means
我们用一个聚类来运行K均值聚类方法

60
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,340
with one cluster, that means really,
这就意味着

61
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,840
everything gets grouped into a
所有的数据都会分到一个

62
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,530
single cluster and compute the
聚类里 然后计算

63
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,850
cost function or compute the distortion
成本函数或者计算畸变函数

64
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,490
J and plot that here.
J 并将其画在这儿

65
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,090
And then we're going to run K
之后我们又用两个聚类来运行K

66
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,270
means with two clusters, maybe
均值聚类 也许

67
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,430
with multiple random initial agents, maybe not.
有多个随机的初始中心 也许没有

68
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,150
But then, you know,
但是之后 你知道的

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,280
with two clusters we should
有两个聚类 我们

70
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,510
get, hopefully, a smaller distortion,
所期望得到的是一个较小的畸变值

71
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,820
and so plot that there.
把它画在这儿

72
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,100
And then run K-means with three
之后用选用3个聚类来运行K均值聚类

73
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,590
clusters, hopefully, you get even
你期望得到一个更

74
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,680
smaller distortion and plot that there.
小的畸变值 并把它画在这儿

75
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,710
I'm gonna run K-means with four, five and so on.
之后再用4，5等聚类数来运行均值聚类

76
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,790
And so we end up with
最后我们就能得到

77
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,840
a curve showing how the
一条曲线显示

78
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
distortion, you know, goes
随着我们的聚类数量的增多

79
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,170
down as we increase the number of clusters.
畸变值是如何下降的

80
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,870
And so we get a curve that maybe looks like this.
我们可能会得到一条类似于这样的曲线

81
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,210
And if you look at this
看看这条

82
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,400
curve, what the Elbow Method does
曲线 这就是“肘部法则”所做的

83
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,770
it says "Well, let's look at this plot.
让我们来看这样一个图

84
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,340
Looks like there's a clear elbow there".
看起来就好像有一个很清楚的肘在那儿

85
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,620
Right, this is, would be by
对吧 这就

86
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,210
analogy to the human arm where,
类比于人的手臂

87
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,620
you know, if you imagine that
想象一下

88
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,460
you reach out your arm,
如果你伸出你的胳膊

89
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,940
then, this is your
那么这就是你的

90
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,340
shoulder joint, this is your
肩关节 这就是你的

91
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,960
elbow joint and I guess, your hand is at the end over here.
肘关节 我猜你的手就在这里的终端

92
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,170
And so this is the Elbow Method.
这就是“肘部法则”

93
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,930
Then you find this sort of pattern
你会发现这种模式

94
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,630
where the distortion goes down rapidly
它的畸变值会迅速下降

95
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,120
from 1 to 2, and 2 to
从1到2 从2到

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,330
3, and then you reach an
3 之后你会

97
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,160
elbow at 3, and then
在3的时候达到一个肘点 在此之后

98
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,260
the distortion goes down very slowly after that.
畸变值就下降的非常慢

99
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,520
And then it looks like, you
看起来就像

100
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,700
know what, maybe using three
使用3个聚类来

101
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,920
clusters is the right
进行聚类是正确的

102
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,340
number of clusters, because that's
这是因为那个点

103
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,430
the elbow of this curve, right?
是曲线的肘点

104
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,040
That it goes down, distortion goes
畸变值下降

105
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,290
down rapidly until K equals
得很快知道K等于

106
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,700
3, really goes down very slowly after that.
3 之后就下降得很慢

107
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,850
So let's pick K equals 3.
那么我们就选K等于3

108
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,570
If you apply the Elbow Method,
当你应用“肘部法则” 的时候

109
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,240
and if you get a plot
如果你得到了一个

110
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,450
that actually looks like this,
像这样的图

111
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,120
then, that's pretty good, and
那么这非常好

112
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,160
this would be a reasonable way
这将是一种用来

113
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,590
of choosing the number of clusters.
选择聚类个数的合理方法

114
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,600
It turns out the Elbow Method
而事实证明“肘部法则”

115
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,170
isn't used that often, and one
并不那么常用 其中一个

116
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,270
reason is that, if you
原因是如果你

117
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,470
actually use this on
把这种方法用到

118
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,060
a clustering problem, it turns out that
一个聚类问题上 事实证明

119
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,640
fairly often, you know,
这种想象是相当常见的

120
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,610
you end up with a curve
你最后得到了一条

121
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,940
that looks much more ambiguous, maybe something like this.
看上去相当模棱两可的曲线 也许就像这样

122
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,370
And if you look at this,
请看这个

123
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,220
I don't know, maybe there's
我不知道 也许没有

124
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,580
no clear elbow, but it
一个清晰的肘点 但是

125
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,090
looks like distortion continuously goes down,
看上去畸变值是连续下降的

126
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,570
maybe 3 is a
也许3是比较

127
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,680
good number, maybe 4 is
好的一个数字 也许4是

128
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,180
a good number, maybe 5 is also not bad.
一个比较好的数字 也许5也并不糟糕

129
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,190
And so, if you actually
那么如果你在

130
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,710
do this in a practice, you know,
实际操作中做这样一个事情的话

131
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,690
if your plot looks like the one on the left and that's great.
如果你的图像左边这个的话 那么就太好了

132
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,990
It gives you a clear answer, but
它会给你一个清晰的答案 但是

133
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,550
just as often, you end
通常 你最终

134
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,580
up with a plot that looks
得到的图是像

135
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,020
like the one on the right and
右边的那个

136
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,000
is not clear where the
并不能清晰指定

137
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,230
ready location of the elbow
肘点合适的位置

138
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,440
is. It  makes it harder to
这使得

139
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,700
choose a number of clusters using this method.
用这个方法来选择聚类数目变得较为困难

140
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,220
So maybe the quick summary
对于“肘部法则”快速的小结

141
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
of the Elbow Method is that is worth the shot
就是它使一个值得尝试的方法

142
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,350
but I wouldn't necessarily,
但是我不会必然地

143
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,700
you know, have a very high
对它有很高的

144
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,360
expectation of it working for any particular problem.
期望来解决任何一个特定的问题

145
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,030
Finally, here's one other way
最后 有另外一种方法

146
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,850
of how, thinking about how
引导你如何

147
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,980
you choose the value of K,
选择K值

148
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,030
very often people are running
通常人们运行

149
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,380
K-means in order you
K均值聚类方法是为了

150
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,770
get clusters for some later
得到一些聚类用于后面的

151
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,880
purpose, or for some sort of downstream purpose.
一些用途 或者是一些下游的目的

152
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,900
Maybe you want to use K-means
也许你会用K均值聚类方法

153
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,460
in order to do market segmentation,
来做市场分割

154
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,600
like in the T-shirt sizing example that we talked about.
如我们之前谈论的T恤尺寸的例子

155
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,570
Maybe you want K-means to organize
也许你会用K均值聚类来使得

156
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,300
a computer cluster better, or
电脑的聚类变得更好 或者

157
