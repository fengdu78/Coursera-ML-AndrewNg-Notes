00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,210
to start telling you about how
开始向你介绍

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:04,970
we represent Neural Networks,
我们该如何表示神经网络

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,690
in other words how we represent
换句话说 当我们在

5
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:08,130
our hypotheses or how
运用神经网络时

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,270
we represent our model when using your Neural Networks.
我们该如何表示我们的假设或模型

7
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,750
Neural Networks were developed at
神经网络是在模仿

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,650
simulating neurons or networks of neurons in the brain.
大脑中的神经元或者神经网络时发明的

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,830
So, to explain the hypotheses
因此 要解释如何表示

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,330
representation. Let's start by
模型假设 我们先来看单个

11
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,590
looking at what a single
神经元在大脑中

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,250
neuron in the brain looks like.
是什么样的

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,630
Your brain and mine is jam-packed
我们的大脑中充满了

14
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,610
full of neurons like these
这样的神经元

15
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,300
and neurons are cells in
神经元是大脑中的细胞

16
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,740
the brain and the two
其中有两点

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,740
things to draw attention to are
值得我们注意

18
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,590
that first that the
一是神经元有

19
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,820
neuron has a cell body
像这样的细胞主体

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,320
like so and moreover, the
二是神经元有

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,480
neuron has a number of
一定数量的

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,060
input wires and these are
输入神经

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,360
called the dendrites who think of
这些输入神经叫做树突

24
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,370
them as input wires and
可以把它们想象成输入电线

25
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,500
these receive inputs from other
它们接收来自其他

26
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,330
locations and the neuron
神经元的信息

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,270
also has an output wire called the axon.
神经元的输出神经叫做轴突

28
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,710
And this output wire
这些输出神经

29
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,910
is what it uses to send
是用来

30
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,690
signal to other neurons
给其他神经元传递信号

31
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,130
or to send messages to other neurons.
或者传送信息的

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,220
So, at a simplistic level, what
简而言之

33
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:08,740
a neuron is is a computational
神经元是一个计算单元

34
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,470
unit that gets a number
它从输入神经接受一定数目的信息

35
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,220
of inputs through its input wires, does some computation.
并做一些计算

36
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,700
and then it sends outputs, via its
然后将结果通过它的

37
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,640
axon to other nodes
轴突传送到其他节点

38
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,540
or other neurons in the brain.
或者大脑中的其他神经元

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,370
Here's an illustration of a group of neurons.
下面是一组神经元的示意图

40
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,350
The way that neurons communicate
神经元利用微弱的电流

41
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,410
with each other is with little pulses of electricities.
进行沟通

42
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,820
They're also called spikes, but they're just means of little pulse of electricity.
这些弱电流也称作动作电位 其实就是一些微弱的电流

43
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,000
So, here's one neuron and what
所以如果

44
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,060
it does is if it
神经元想要

45
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,260
wants to send a message,
传递一个消息

46
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,280
what it does is it sends
它就会就通过它的轴突

47
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,190
the little pulse of electricity via its
发送一段微弱电流

48
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,110
axon to some difference
给其他神经元

49
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,610
neuron and here this axon.
这就是轴突

50
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,310
There is this open wire.
这里是一条

51
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,840
Connects to the input wire or
连接到输入神经

52
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,270
connects to the dendrite of this
或者连接另一个神经元

53
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,300
second neuron over here, which
树突的神经

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,860
then accepts this incoming message
接下来这个神经元接收这条消息

55
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,510
does some computation and may
做一些计算

56
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,710
in turn decide to send
它有可能会反过来将

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,450
out its O messages on its
在轴突上的

58
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,090
axon to other neurons.
自己的消息传给其他神经元

59
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,740
And this is the process by
这就是所有

60
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,570
which all human thought
人类思考的模型：

61
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,540
happens as these neurons doing
我们的神经元把

62
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,150
computations and passing messages
自己的收到的消息进行计算

63
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,120
to other neurons as a
并向其他神经元

64
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,560
result of what other inputs they've got.
传递消息

65
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,560
And by the way, this is how
顺便说一下 这也是

66
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,030
our senses and our muscles work as well.
我们的感觉和肌肉运转的原理

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,340
If you want to move one
如果你想活动一块肌肉

68
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,460
of your muscles, the way that
就会触发一个神经元

69
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,110
works is that a neuron may
给你的肌肉

70
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,370
send these pulses of electricities
发送脉冲

71
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,590
to your muscle and that causes
并引起

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,440
your muscles to contract and your
你的肌肉收缩

73
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,030
eyes - if some
如果一些感官

74
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,510
sensor like your eye
比如说眼睛

75
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,710
wants to send a message to
想要给大脑传递

76
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,810
your brain, what it does
一个消息

77
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,900
is it sends its pulses of
那么它就像这样发送

78
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,670
electricity to a neuron in your brain like so.
电脉冲给大脑的

79
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,490
In a neural network, or
在一个神经网络里

80
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,700
rather in an artificial neural
或者说在我们在电脑上

81
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,250
network that we implement in
实现的人工神经网络里

82
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,980
a computer, we're going to
我们将使用

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
use a very simple model
一个非常简单的模型

84
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,380
of what a neuron does.
来模拟神经元的工作

85
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,720
We're going to model a neuron as just a logistic unit.
我们将神经元模拟成一个逻辑单元

86
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,480
So, when I draw a yellow
当我画一个这样的

87
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,130
circle like that, you should hink of
黄色圆圈时 你应该

88
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,130
that as playing a
把它想象成

89
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,710
role analogous to maybe the
作用类似于

90
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,480
body of a neuron, and
神经元的东西

91
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,840
we then feed the neuron a
然后我们通过

92
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,670
few inputs via its dendrites or
它的树突或者说它的输入神经

93
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,150
its input wires and the neuron does some computation
传递给它一些信息 然后神经元做一些计算

94
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,050
and output some value on
并通过它的输出神经

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,260
this output wire or in
即它的轴突

96
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,400
a biological neuron that sorts
输出计算结果

97
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,160
the axon and whenever I
当我画一个

98
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,660
draw a diagram like this, what
像这样的图表时

99
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,020
this means is that this represents
就表示对h(x)的计算

100
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,040
a computations of, you know, h of x equals 1
h(x)等于1除以

101
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,290
over 1 + e to
1加e的

102
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,590
the negative theta transpose x where, as
负θ转置乘以 x

103
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,330
usual, x and theta
通常  x和θ

104
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,610
are our parameter vectors like so.
是我们的参数向量

105
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,410
So, this is a very simple maybe
这是一个简单的模型

106
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,490
a vastly over simplified model of
甚至说是一个过于简单的

107
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,050
the computation that the neuron
模拟神经元的模型

108
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,200
does where it gets the
它被输入 x1  x2和 x3

109
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,790
number of inputs, x1, x2,
然后输出一些

110
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,150
x3 and it outputs some value computed like so.
类似这样的结果

111
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,250
When I draw a neural network,
当我绘制一个神经网络时

112
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,430
usually I draw only the
通常我只绘制

113
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,770
input nose x1, x2, x3,
输入节点 x1  x2  x3

114
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,740
sometimes when it's useful to do so.
但有时也可以这样做：

115
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,780
I draw an extra node for x zero.
我增加一个额外的节点 x0

116
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,200
This x zero node is
这个 x0 节点

117
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,960
sometimes called the bias unit
有时也被称作偏置单位

118
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,970
or the bias neuron but because
或偏置神经元 但因为

119
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,350
x0 is already equal to 1.
x0 总是等于1

120
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,320
Sometimes, I draw with it, sometimes
所以有时候 我会画出它

121
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,280
I won't just depending on whether
有时我不会画出

122
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,560
there's more the rotationally convenient for that example.
这取决于它是否对例子有利

123
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,810
Finally, one last
现在来讨论

124
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,800
bit of terminology when we
最后一个关于

125
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,690
talk about neural networks, sometimes
神经网络的术语

126
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,500
we'll say that this
有时我们会说

127
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,330
is a neuron - an
这是一个神经元

128
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,720
artificial neuron  with a sigmoid or a logistic
一个有s型函数或者逻辑函数作为激励函数的

129
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,250
activation function.
人工神经元

130
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,030
So this activation function in the neuronetro
在神经网络术语中

131
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,200
terminology, this is just
激励函数只是对类似非线性

132
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,210
another term for that
函数g(z)的另一个术语称呼

133
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,190
function for that non-linearity g
g(z)等于

134
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,170
of z, equals 1
1除以1

135
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,020
over 1 plus e to the negative z.
加e的-z次方

136
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,410
And whereas so far
到目前为止

137
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,090
I've been calling theta the parameters
我一直称θ为

138
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,500
of the model are mostly continued
模型的参数

139
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,790
to use that terminology to conjugate
以后大概会继续将这个术语与

140
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
to the parameters, but the neural networks.
“参数”相对应 而不是与神经网络

141
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,960
In the neural networks literature and
在关于神经网络的文献里

142
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,290
sometimes you might hear people
有时你可能会看到人们

143
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,160
talk about weights of a
谈论一个模型的权重

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,760
model and weights just means
权重其实和

145
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,490
exactly the same thing as
模型的参数

146
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,470
parameters of the model.
是一样的东西

147
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,890
But almost to use the terminology
在视频中

148
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,010
parameters in these videos,
我会继续使用“参数”这个术语

149
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,180
but sometimes you may hear others use the weights terminology.
但有时你可能听到别人用“权重”这个术语

150
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,290
So, this little
这个小圈

151
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,340
diagram represents a single neuron.
代表一个单一的神经元

152
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,790
What a neural network is
神经网络其实就是

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,590
Is just a proof of
这些不同的神经元

154
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,500
these different neurons strung together.
组合在一起的集合

155
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,770
Concretely, here we have
具体来说 这里是我们的

156
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,070
input units x1, x2, and x3
输入单元 x1  x2和 x3

157
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,170
and once again,
再说一次

158
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,070
sometimes can draw this
有时也可以画上

159
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,760
extra node x0 or sometimes
额外的节点 x0

160
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,490
not. So, I just draw that in here.
我把 x0 画在这了

161
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,950
And here we have
这里有

162
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,800
three neurons, which I
3个神经元

163
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,890
have written, you know, a(2)1, a(2)2 and
我在里面写了a(2)1 a(2)2

164
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,250
a(2)3 around top bottles indices
和a(2)3

165
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,140
later and once again,
然后再次说明

166
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,790
we can if we want
我们可以在这里

167
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,440
adding this a0 and
添加一个a0

168
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,840
add an extra bias unit there.
和一个额外的偏度单元

169
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,030
It always outputs the value of 1.
它的值永远是1

170
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,680
Then finally we have this
最后 我们在

171
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,450
third node at the final
最后一层有第三个节点

172
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,800
layer, and it's this
正是这第三个节点

173
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,600
third node that opens the value
输出

174
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,020
that the hypotheses h of x computes.
假设函数h(x)计算的结果

175
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,480
To introduce a bit
再多说一点关于

176
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,250
more terminology in a neural
神经网络的术语

177
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,340
network, the first layer, this
网络中的第一层

178
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,610
is also called the input
也被称为输入层

179
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,160
layer because this is where
因为我们在这一层

180
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,510
we input our features, x1 x2 x3.
输入我们的特征项 x1 x2 x3

181
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,560
The final layer is
最后一层

182
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,190
also called the output layer
也称为输出层

183
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,550
because that layer has
因为这一层的

184
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,010
the neuron - this one over
神经元—我指的这个

185
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,340
here - that outputs the
输出

186
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,980
final value computed by a
假设的最终计算结果

187
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,180
hypotheses and then layer
中间的两层

188
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,900
two in between, this is called the hidden layer.
也被称作隐藏层

189
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,300
The term hidden layer isn't a
隐藏层不是一个

190
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,290
great terminology, but the
很合适的术语 但是

191
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
intuition is that, you know, in
直觉上我们知道

192
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,450
supervised learning where you
在监督学习中

193
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,820
get to see the inputs, and you get to see the correct outputs.
你能看到输入 也能看到正确的输出

194
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,530
Whereas the hidden layer are values you
而隐藏层的值

195
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,260
don't get to observe in the training set.
你在训练集里是看不到的

196
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,280
If it's not x and it's not y and so we call those hidden.
它的值不是 x 也不是y 所以我们叫它隐藏层

197
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,860
and later on we'll see neural
稍后我们会看到神经网络

198
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,260
networks with more than
可以有不止一个的

199
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,690
one hidden layer, but in
隐藏层 但在

200
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,290
this example we have one
这个例子中 我们有一个

201
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,010
input layer, layer 1; one hidden
输入层—第1层 一个隐藏层—

202
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,900
layer, layer 2; and one output layer, layer 3.
第2层 和一个输出层—第3层

203
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,530
But basically anything that isn't
但实际上任何

204
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,260
an input layer and isn't a
非输入层或非输出层的层

205
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,480
output layer is called a hidden layer.
就被称为隐藏层

206
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,620
So, I
接下来

207
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,610
want to be really clear
我希望你们明白神经网络

208
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,130
about what this neural network is doing.
究竟在做什么

209
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,840
Let's step through the computational
让我们逐步分析

210
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,600
steps that are embodied
这个图表所呈现的

211
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,410
by this, represented by this diagram.
计算步骤

212
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,800
To explain the specific computations
为了解释这个神经网络

213
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,960
represented by a neural network,
具体的计算步骤

214
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,910
here's a little bit more notation.
这里还有些记号要解释

215
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,400
I'm going to use a superscript
我要使用a上标(j)

216
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,520
j subscript i to denote
下标i表示

217
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,640
the activation of neuron i
第j层的

218
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,390
or of unit i in layer
第i个神经元或单元

219
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,290
j.  So concretely, this
具体来说 这里

220
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,280
a superscript 2 subscript 1
a上标(2) 下标1

221
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,930
does the activation of the
表示第2层的

222
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,320
first unit in layer 2,
第一个激励

223
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,140
in our hidden layer.
即隐藏层的第一个激励

224
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,640
And by activation, I just mean,
所谓激励(activation) 是指

225
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,360
you know, the value that is computed
由一个具体神经元读入

226
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,530
by and that is output by a specific.
计算并输出的值

227
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
In addition, our neural network
此外 我们的神经网络

228
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,050
is parametrized by these matrices,
被这些矩阵参数化

229
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,520
theta superscript j where
θ上标(j)

230
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,600
our theta j is going to
它将成为

231
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,820
be a matrix of waves
一个波矩阵

232
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,770
controlling the function mapping from
控制着

233
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,780
one layer, maybe the first
从一层 比如说从第一层

234
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,360
layer to the second layer or from the second layer to the third layer.
到第二层或者第二层到第三层的作用

235
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,990
So, here are the computations that are represented by this diagram.
所以 这就是这张图所表示的计算

236
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,770
This first hidden unit here,
这里的第一个隐藏单元

237
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,600
has its value computed as
是这样计算它的值的：

238
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,020
follows: is a a(2)1 is
a(2)1等于

239
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,980
equal to the sigmoid
s函数

240
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,240
function, or the sigmoid activation function
或者说s激励函数

241
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,550
also called the logistic activation function,
也叫做逻辑激励函数

242
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,730
applied to this sort
作用在这种

243
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,360
of linear combination of its inputs.
输入的线性组合上的结果

244
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,560
And then this second hidden
第二个隐藏单元

245
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,330
unit has this activation
等于s函数作用在这个

246
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,400
value computed as sigmoid of this.
线性组合上的值

247
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,110
And similarly, for this
同样 对于第三个

248
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,010
third hidden unit, it's computed by that formula.
隐藏的单元 它是通过这个公式计算的

249
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,060
So here, we have three
在这里 我们有三个

250
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,960
input units and the three hidden units.
输入单元和三个隐藏单元

251
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,840
And so the dimension
这样一来

252
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,530
of theta one which the
参数矩阵控制了

253
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,590
matrix of parameters governing our
我们来自

254
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,870
mapping from all three input
三个输入单元

255
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,530
units, about three hidden units
三个隐藏单元的映射

256
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,210
theta 1 is going to
因此θ1的维数

257
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,390
be a 3,
将变成3

258
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,870
theta 1 is going to
θ1将变成一个

259
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,640
be a 3 by 4 dimensional
3乘4维的

260
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,620
matrix and more generally,
矩阵 更一般的

261
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,440
if a network has Sj
如果一个网络在第j

262
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,710
units and their j
层有sj个单元

263
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,440
and Sj + 1 units
在j+1层有

264
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,980
in their j + 1 then
sj+1个单元

265
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,700
the matrix theta j which
那么矩阵θ(j)

266
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,560
governs the function mapping from
即控制第j层到

267
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,390
layer j to layer j +
第j+1层映射

268
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,660
1 that we'll have to mention
的矩阵的

269
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,160
Sj + 1 by Sj + 1.
维度为s(j+1) * (sj+1)

270
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,390
Just be clear about this notation, right?
这里要搞清楚

271
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,440
This is S subscript j
这个是s下标j+1

272
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,810
+ 1 and that's S
而这个是

273
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,260
subscript j, and then
s下标j 然后

274
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,060
this whole thing, plus 1.
整体加上1

275
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,860
Of this whole thing, that's j + 1, okay?
整体加1 明白了吗

276
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,730
So that's S subscript j plus
所以θ(j)的维度是

277
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:22,400
1 plus, by So,
s(j+1)行 sj+1列

278
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,090
that's S subscript j plus
这里sj+1

279
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,230
1 by Sj
当中的1

280
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,460
+ 1 where as plus 1 is not part of the subscript.
不是下标的一部分

281
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,520
So, we talked about what
以上我们讨论了

282
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,120
the three hidden units do to compute their values.
三个隐藏单位是怎么计算它们的值

283
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,240
Finally, this last, the spinal in optimal
最后 在输出层

284
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,280
layer, we have one more
我们还有一个

285
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,270
units which computes h of
单元 它计算

286
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,090
x and that's equal, can
h(x)  这个也可以

287
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,210
also be written as a(3)1
写成a(3)1

288
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:50,830
and that's equal to this.
就等于后面这块

289
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,110
And you notice that I've
注意到我这里

290
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,480
written this with a superscript
写了个上标2

291
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,380
2 here because theta superscript
因为θ上标2

292
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,340
2 is the matrix of parameters,
是参数矩阵

293
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,170
or the matrix of weights that
或着说是权重矩阵 该矩阵

294
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,830
controls the function that maps
控制从第二层

295
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,090
from the hidden units, that
即隐藏层的3个单位

296
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,850
is the layer 2 units,
到第三层

297
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,230
to the 1 layer 3
的一个单元

298
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,840
unit that is the output
即输出单元

299
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:12,360
unit.
的映射

300
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,460
To summarize, what we've done
总之 以上我们

301
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,900
is shown how a picture
展示了像这样一张图是

302
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,670
like this over here defines
怎样定义

303
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,280
an artificial neural network which defines
一个人工神经网络的

304
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,160
a function h that maps
这个神经网络定义了函数h：

305
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,880
your x's input values to hopefully
从输入 x

306
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,650
to some space and provisions y?
到输出y的映射

307
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,430
And these hypotheses after parametrized
我将这些假设的参数

308
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,600
by parameters that I
记为大写的θ

309
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,070
am denoting with a capital
这样一来

310
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,020
theta so that as
不同的θ

311
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,920
we be vary theta we get different hypotheses.
对应了不同的假设

312
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,930
So we get different functions mapping
所以我们有不同的函数

313
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,490
say from x to y.   So
比如说从 x到y的映射

314
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,000
this gives us a mathematical
以上就是我们怎么

315
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,980
definition of how to
从数学上定义

316
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,400
represent the hypotheses in the neural network.
神经网络的假设

317
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,750
In the next few videos, what
在接下来的视频中

318
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,930
I'd like to do is give
我想要做的就是

319
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,580
you more intuition about what
让你对这些假设的作用

320
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,280
these hypotheses representations do, as
有更深入的理解

321
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,290
